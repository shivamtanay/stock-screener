Rating Rationale Rating Rationale May 07, 2025 | Mumbai Chandan Healthcare Limited Rating migrated to 'Crisil BBB-/Stable' Rating Action Total Bank Loan Facilities Rated Rs.20 Crore Long Term Rating Crisil BBB-/Stable (Migrated from 'Crisil BB-/Stable ISSUER NOT COOPERATING*') Note: None of the Directors on Crisil Ratings Limited’s Board are members of rating committee and thus do not participate in discussion or assignment of any ratings. The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings. 1 crore = 10 million Refer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities *Issuer did not cooperate; based on best-available information Detailed Rationale Due to inadequate information and in line with the Securities and Exchange Board of India guidelines, Crisil Ratings had migrated its rating on the long-term bank facilities of Chandan Healthcare Limited (CHL) to ‘Crisil BB-/Stable Issuer Not Cooperating’. However, the management has subsequently started sharing requisite information, necessary for carrying out comprehensive review of the rating. Consequently, Crisil Ratings is migrating the rating on bank facilities of CHL to ‘Crisil BBB-/Stable’ from ‘Crisil BB-/Stable Issuer Not Cooperating' The rating continues to reflect the extensive experience of the promoter in the healthcare industry, and the moderate financial risk profile of the company. These strengths are partially offset by working capital-intensive operations and limited track record of sustenance of operating profitability. Analytical Approach Crisil Ratings has combined the business and financial risk profiles of CHL, Chandan Pharmacy Ltd (CPL) and Indra Diagnostic Centre & Blood Bank Ltd (IDCBBL). This is because IDCBBL is a wholly owned subsidiary of CHL and the latter holds 53% stake in CPL. Please refer Annexure - List of Entities Consolidated, which captures the list of entities considered and their analytical treatment of consolidation Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description Strengths: Extensive experience of the promoter: The three-decade-long experience of the promoter in the healthcare industry, their strong understanding of market dynamics and established relationships with suppliers and customers, will continue to support the business risk profile. This has aided sustained improvement in the business risk profile of CHL, supported by steady growth in revenue and operating margin. Revenue recorded a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24% over the three fiscals ended March 31, 2024, and is projected to show a further year on year growth of 30-35% to around Rs 215-225 crore during fiscal 2025; revenue is estimated to be around Rs 167 crore till December 2024. Revenue growth will be aided by expansion of network and the addition of new customers. Further, the operating margin is expected to sustain around 15-16% in fiscal 2025, backed by healthy collections at new centers. In March-2025, the group acquired X-Life diagnostics for Rs 6.75 crore which owned a diagnostic center at a prime location in Patna, Bihar which is running profitably. Management is targeting to open 3 additional centers each year in order to continuously grow and expand its reach. Sustained improvement in the scale of operations while sustaining healthy margins amid expansion of the network would remain monitorable Healthy financial risk profile: The financial risk profile is marked by moderate networth and gearing projected to be in the range of Rs 135-140 crore and below 0.4 time, respectively, as on March 31, 2025, as against Rs 44 crore and 0.95 time, respectively, a year before. Improvement in networth will be supported by funds raised through the IPO, amounting to Rs 107 crore in February 2025, and steady accretion to reserves. The sustaining operating margin and limited dependence on bank debt kept debt protection indicators healthy, with interest coverage projected to be 8-9 times for fiscal 2025. In the absence of any debt-funded capital expenditure plans, the financial risk profile is expected to remain comfortable over the medium term. Weaknesses: Working capital-intensive operations: Gross current assets (GCAs) stood at 119 days as on March 31, 2024, driven by receivables of 58 days and inventory of 47 days. GCA days are likely to remain around 100-110 days over the medium term, as payments from government departments under the National Health Mission, are generally received within 60-90 days. This has led to higher working capital requirement and higher utilization of bank lines, however, post fundraising in Feb-2025, the same has been moderated. Going forward, efficient working capital management, leading to moderation in bank limit utilization, will be a key monitorable. Liquidity: Adequate Bank limit utilization is around 78 percent for the past twelve months ending March-2025. Cash accrual are expected to be over Rs 20-28 crore which are sufficient against term debt obligation of Rs 5-7 crore over the medium term. In addition, will act as a cushion to the liquidity of the company. The current ratio is around 0.8 times on March 31, 2024. The promoters are likely to extend support in the form of equity and unsecured loans to meet its working capital requirements and repayment obligations. Outlook: Stable Crisil Ratings believes CHL will continue to benefit from the extensive experience of its promoter in the healthcare industry and established relationships with clients. Rating Sensitivity Factors Upward factors: Sustained growth in operating income and sustenance of operating margin over 14-15% leading to higher-than-expected net cash accruals Efficient working capital management Downward factors: Decline in scale of operations or operating margin below 9-10%, leading to lower-than-expected net cash accruals Stretch in working capital cycle leading to weakening of financial and liquidity profiles About the Group Incorporated in 2003, CHL provides diagnostic services related to radiology, pathology, cardiology, health check-ups, electromyogram, electroencephalogram, audiometry, endoscopy, pulmonary function test, allergies, auditory brainstem response, electromyography, nerve conduction velocity and bone mineral density. The company also operates pharmacies and a blood bank. Promoted by Dr Amar Singh, CHL is present in Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Uttarakhand. CPL, incorporated in 2018, trades in medicines and owns and runs retail pharmacy units, with more than 50% stake held by CHL. IDCBBL runs a diagnostic centre Agra and Gorakhpur.

RATING ACTION / OUTLOOK / NATURE OF NON-COOPERATION Brickwork Ratings (BWR) has downgraded the ratings at ‘BWR BB+/Stable/BWR A4+’ for the bank loan facilities of Tarmat Ltd. The rating has also been classified under the ‘ISSUER NOT COOPERATING category. The ratings are due for review in Feb 2024, BWR took up with the company recently over emails and through telephone calls to obtain the required information. Despite the best efforts of BWR to get at least the minimum required information for a review, the entity has not provided the same. Thus, due to lack of management cooperation to furnish adequate information about the company's performance despite follow up, BWR is unable to assess its financial performance or its ability to service its debt and maintain a valid rating. Accordingly, the ratings have been downgraded and migratated in the “Issuer Not Cooperating” category. The rating downgrade is based on the lack of up-to-date information on the company’s performance. The lenders/investors may note to exercise due caution while using the above rating which mentions "Issuer Not Cooperating" since the rating lack any projections or forward looking component as it is arrived at based on the best available information without any management/banker's interaction. LIMITATIONS OF THE RATING Information availability risk is a key factor in the assessment of credit risk as generally, non-cooperation by the rated entities to provide the required information for a review of the assigned rating may also be accompanied by financial stress. Users of the credit rating should, therefore, take into account the possible deterioration in the credit quality of the rated entity arising from its non-transparency and withholdings of the information required for a review of the rating.

Rating Rationale Rating Rationale November 19, 2024 | Mumbai Viceroy HotelsRating reaffirmed at 'CRISIL BB-/Stable' Rating ActionTotal Bank Loan Facilities RatedRs.24.5 CroreLong Term RatingCRISIL BB-/Stable (Reaffirmed)Note: None of the Directors on CRISIL Ratings Limited’s Board are members of rating committee and thus do not participate in discussion or assignment of any ratings. The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities Detailed rationale CRISIL Ratings has reaffirmed its ‘CRISIL BB-/Stable’ rating on the long term bank facilities of Viceroy Hotels (VH). The ratings reflect the extensive industry experience of the partners of VH. These strengths are partially offset by the geographic concentration in revenue profile and weakened financial risk profile. Analytical approach CRISIL Ratings has evaluated the standalone business and financial risk profiles of VH. Key rating drivers and detailed description Strength: Extensive industry experience of the partners: The partners have experience of over four decades in the hotels and resorts industry. This has given them an understanding of the dynamics of the market and enabled them to establish relationships with suppliers and customers. Weaknesses: Vulnerability to cyclicality in the hospitality industry: The hotel industry is vulnerable to changes in the domestic and international economies. Typically, the industry follows a six-year cycle. Companies which have a high financial leverage are more vulnerable to cyclicality due to their fixed financial commitments. Weakened financial risk profile: The financial risk profile of the firm is marked by a weak capital structure and moderate debt protection metrics. Networth was about Rs 5.42 crore as on March 31, 2024. Gearing was significantly high at 6.23 times as on March 31, 2024, driven by large debt. Debt protection metrics are also moderate as reflected in interest coverage and net cash accrual to total debt ratios of 2.55 times and 0.05 time, respectively, in fiscal 2024. Liquidity: Stretched Bank limit utilisation averaged a high 92% for the 12 months ended September 2024. Expected cash accrual of Rs 3.90-4.50 crore are tightly matched term against debt obligation of Rs 3-4 crore over the medium term. Current ratio was low at 0.64 time as on March 31, 2024. The partners have withdrawn Rs 2.32 crore in fiscal 2024, which resulted in a decline in the networth. Cash and bank balance was moderate around Rs 74 lakh as on March 31, 2024. Outlook: Stable CRISIL Ratings believes VH will continue to benefit from the extensive experience of its partners, and established relationships with clients. Rating sensitivity factors Upward factors Substantial and sustainable increase in revenue and profitability, leading to cash accrual of Rs 5 crore Gearing improving to below 3 times. Downward factors Decline in profitability to below 10% Large, debt-funded capital expenditure or any sizeable stretch in the working capital cycle About the firm Set up in 2005, VH is engaged in the operation of 3 three-star hotels, which are self-owned and managed under the brand name The President Hotel. All three hotels are located in Karnataka—Bengaluru ( Jayanagar, Kumara Park) and Hubbali. VH is owned and managed by Mr Jagannath V Pai and family. Key financial indicators As on / for the period ended March 31 2024 2023 Operating income Rs crore 53.89 40.74 Reported profit after tax (PAT) Rs crore 1.51 (0.73) PAT margin % 2.80 (1.79) Adjusted debt/Adjusted networth Times 6.23 5.57 Interest coverage Times 2.54 2.12 Any other information: Not Applicable Note on complexity levels of the rated instrument: CRISIL Ratings` complexity levels are assigned to various types of financial instruments and are included (where applicable) in the 'Annexure - Details of Instrument' in this Rating Rationale.

The instrument-wise rating actions are as follows: Details of Instruments Instrument Type Date of Issuance Coupon Rate Maturity Date Size of Issue (million) Rating assigned along with Outlook/Watch Rating Action Fund-based working capital limits---INR100IND BBB/NegativeAssignedProposed term loan--31 December 2033INR1,500IND BBB/NegativeAssignedTerm loan--31 December 2033INR1,500IND BBB/NegativeAssignedTerm loan--31 December 2033INR5,819.70 (reduced from INR5,999.80)IND BBB/NegativeDowngradedNon-fund-based working capital limits---INR600IND BBB/Negative/IND A3+DowngradedFund-based working capital limits---INR350IND BBB/NegativeDowngradedAnalytical Approach Ind-Ra continues to take a top-down approach under its Parent Subsidiary Linkage Rating Criteria to arrive at ACL’s rating, given the strong linkages between ACL and its parent, Sagar Cements Limited (SCL; ‘IND BBB+’/Negative), which acquired ACL in March 2023. Detailed Rationale of the Rating Action The downgrade reflects the likelihood of SCL’s performance being significantly weaker-than-Ind-Ra’s expectation over FY25-FY26 with a lower EBITDA generation leading to higher net debt levels and reduced liquidity cushion. With the sharp fall in cement prices in FY25, Ind-Ra expects SCL’s EBITDA/metric tonne (mt) to have declined in FY25, which coupled with flattish volumes, is likely to have resulted in a significant decline in the EBITDA, against its earlier expectations of some recovery. However, Ind-Ra expects the sale volumes to improve in FY26 led by an improvement in infrastructure demand in the region as well as completion of capex at its subsidiary ACL by 1HFYE26. After witnessing the sharpest fall in prices in the last decade, Ind-Ra expects cement prices to witness some stability and improvement in FY26, which could improve SCL’s profitability. However, notwithstanding some improvement, Ind-Ra expects SCL’s EBITDA to remain significantly lower than its earlier expectations in FY26.  Ind-Ra had earlier factored in the management’s commitment to structure its capex plans according to cash flow generation to ensure a reduction in the net leverage (net debt/operating EBITDA) below 3.5x latest by FY26. However, with the ongoing capex amid the weak profitability, the deleveraging is likely to be pushed by another year. The weak performance has also reduced the headroom in SCL's liquidity cushion with the likelihood of the entity requiring external funding to support its debt servicing obligations in FY26. The Negative Outlook reflects the potential risk to SCL’s liquidity and deleveraging if the recent price hikes do not sustain, leading to a weaker-than-expected EBITDA in FY26. Although, Ind-Ra takes some comfort from the liquidity of around INR1.4 billion (including unrestricted cash of INR0.7 billion and unused drawable working limits of INR0.7 billion) available at end-March 2025, aided by the working capital release in 4QFY25 and fund infusion in the form of unsecured loans from the promoters. Furthermore, the management is undertaking measures including monetisation of non-core assets and capital raise to improve liquidity and credit metrics, and has also communicated to Ind-Ra of its commitment to inject liquidity into the entity to ensure timely servicing of obligations, if needed. Ind-Ra will continue to closely monitor the profitability and liquidity position of the entity. Ind-Ra continues to draw comfort from SCL's comfortable market position in the cement industry and its geographically diversified operations across three regions. The promoters have over four decades of experience in the cement industry. List of Key Rating Drivers Strengths- Strong linkages with parent - Comfortable market position, likely to improve with capex completion- Geographically diversified with presence in three regions- Adequate raw material linkages and captive power Weaknesses- EBITDA likely to remain weaker-than-expected despite some recovery in FY26- Reduction in liquidity cushion - Further delays in deleveraging amid continued capex and weak EBITDA Detailed Description of Key Rating Drivers Strong Linkages with Parent: Ind-Ra believes the linkages between ACL and SCL to be strong due to operational synergies and ACL’s strategic importance to SCL. This is evident from the significant equity investment and unsecured loans provided by SCL/promoters, along with their commitment to offer further financial and operational support as needed. SCL’s loans and advances to ACL rose to INR0.7 billion at end-December 2024 (FY23: INR0.2 billion) in addition to the investment of INR3.1 billion made in FY23. Furthermore, majority of the capex at the consolidated level is focused on ACL’s capacity expansion, with ACL’s EBITDA contribution likely to rise to 10%-12% in the near term, thus increasing its importance within the group. ACL has also become the key driver of the group’s financial profile given ramp-up of volumes and EBITDA turnaround is critical for SCL’s deleveraging. The acquisition of ACL has enabled SCL to scale up its capacity to 10.5 million tonnes (mnt) as of FY24, which will further increase to 11.25mnt by FY26 with the ongoing capex. This expansion will strengthen SCL’s market position in the southern regions of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, making ACL strategically important to SCL. ACL currently accounts for about 21% of SCL’s consolidated cement capacity, which will rise to approximately 27% post the completion of the ongoing capex. Operational synergies persist as ACL utilises SCL’s marketing network and sells cement under the common brand Sagar, with centralised procurement of raw materials. Ind-Ra believes these strategic linkages will strengthen over time as ACL begins generating significant EBITDA and contributing to the consolidated cash flows. ACL was acquired by SCL through the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code route in March 2023 at a cost of INR9,220 million, including a start-up capex of INR850 million, and working capital and other costs of INR 750 million. The acquisition was funded by term debt of INR 6,000 million, with the balance funded by SCL. According to the resolution plan approved by the National Company Law Tribunal on 16 February 2023, SCL held a 95% stake in ACL, with the remaining stake being held by retail investors. SCL’s management has reduced its stake to 90% and plans to further dilute 15% before December 2025 to comply with the listing regulations. ACL’s board is represented by SCL’s management and common independent directors, with centralised treasury operations. Comfortable Market Position, Likely to Improve with Capex Completion: SCL’s capacity increased by over 80% to 10.5mnt over FY21-FY24 due to a combination of organic and inorganic growth. After completing greenfield projects in Odisha and Madhya Pradesh in 2HFY22, SCL acquired ACL in March 2023. This capacity expansion has strengthened SCL's business profile by improving its market position and geographical presence. The management plans to further increase the capacity to 11.25mnt over the next couple of years with the capex completion at ACL and further to 11.65mnt with the grinding expansion at SCMPL, depending on market conditions and cash flows. Geographically Diversified with Presence in Three Regions: While SCL remained a south focused entity until FY21, the company has expanded its manufacturing presence in central and eastern regions, which have high growth potential. SCL's concentration in the southern region has been decreasing (FY24: 70%, FY23: 75%). In FY24, Andhra Pradesh accounted for 29% of the cement sales, Telangana 24%, Tamil Nadu 10%, and Karnataka 7%. Management expects Telangana (50% of sales mix in FY24), Andhra Pradesh (30%), and Tamil Nadu (20%) to be the key markets for ACL. The infrastructure spending remained weak in FY25 with the general elections leading to subdued demand. Ind-Ra believes the development of Andhra Pradesh's new capital, Amravati, along with increased budget allocations for essential infrastructure such as water, power, railways, and roads over the medium term, is likely to support cement demand in the southern region. Adequate Raw Material Linkages and Captive Power:  Following the ACL acquisition, SCL has consolidated limestone reserves of approximately 944mt, sufficient to meet the medium-to-long-term limestone needs of its existing plants. SCL is also developing feeders for alternative fuel consumption across all its plants, allowing flexibility in fuel choice based on availability and cost. At the consolidated level, SCL has a 73MW captive thermal power generation capacity, a 14.1MW-waste heat recovery plant, and around 16MW of solar and hydro power plants, which are sufficient to meet the power requirements of the entities, including the new capacities being added. The company has also managed to reduce its lead distance by about 38% over FY17-FY24 (FY24: 4%; FY23: 8%). EBITDA Likely to Remain Weaker-than-Expected despite Some Recovery in FY26: SCL’s volumes are likely to have remained flattish in FY25, given the slowdown in demand (9MFY25: down 2% yoy); Ind-Ra expects the sales volume to improve in FY26 backed by infrastructure spending and the completion of ACL capex. The muted demand and sizeable capacity additions resulted in a decadal high fall in prices in FY25, leading to a fall in EBITDA/mt to INR273 in 9MFY25 (9MFY24: INR456). Ind-Ra understands that prices have improved in April 2025 but the sustainability remains a monitorable, given the influx of capacities and a high competitive intensity. Ind-Ra believes the completion of ACL capex plan, along with planned efficiency improvements will enhance the plant’s cost structure, leading to higher margins and better cash generation. ACL recorded sales volume of around 0.5mt in FY24and EBITDA losses of INR32 million. The gradual ramp up of output at ACL post the expanded capacities kick in, coupled with operational efficiencies and fixed-cost absorption is likely to result in improved operational EBITDA at the consolidated level. As a result, while some improvement is likely in FY26, Ind-Ra believes SCL’s EBITDA/mt is likely to remain lower than its earlier expectations. Weak demand and profitability had resulted in a fall in SCL’s EBITDA to INR1 billion in 9MFY25 (9MFY24: INR1.8 billion), with only a likely marginal improvement in 4QFY25. This was against Ind-Ra’s earlier expectation of an improvement in FY25. Reduction in Liquidity Cushion: The weak performance has also reduced the headroom in SCL's liquidity cushion with the likelihood of the entity requiring external funding to support its debt servicing obligations in FY26. Also, if the recent price hikes do not sustain, it could lead to a weaker-than-expected EBITDA and consequently impact the liquidity. Ind-Ra takes some comfort from the liquidity of around INR1.4 billion available at FYE25, aided by the release of working capital in 4QFY25 and fund infusion from the promoters. SCL has scheduled debt repayment obligations of around INR1.4 billion, each, in FY26 and FY27 in addition to the interest obligation of INR1.8 billion-1.9 billion and INR2.1 billion-2.2 billion, respectively, for which the entity may require external funding support. The management is undertaking measures including monetisation of non-core assets and capital raise to improve liquidity and credit metrics, and has also communicated to Ind-Ra of its commitment to inject liquidity to ensure timely servicing of obligations, if needed. The management also plans to pump in funds through promoter entities, along with the dilution of non-core assets and a reduction in the promoter holding in ACL to 75% from the current 90%, in line with the listing requirements to be done before March 2026. Ind-Ra will continue to closely monitor the profitability and liquidity position of the entity. At the consolidated level, SCL’s total cash and cash equivalents stood at INR1.65 billion at FYE25 (FYE24: INR2.6 billion), which includes a free cash balance of INR0.7 billion, a debt service reserve account of INR0.3 billion and INR0.6 billion towards margin money for non-fund-based limits. On a consolidated basis, the average utilisation of the fund-based and non-fund-based limits was around 86% and 82%, respectively, over the 12 months ended March 2025, indicating a moderate liquidity cushion. At the standalone level, SCL's utilisation of fund-based and non-fund-based limits was around 89% and 91%, respectively, over the same period. SCMPL has sanctioned working capital limits of INR1,100 million (fund-based limits: INR350 million with utilisation of 50% over the 12 months ended March 2025; non-fund-based limits: INR750 million, around 77%). ACL’s average use of INR45 million fund-based working capital limits was 86% and non-fund-based limits of INR60 million was 54% over the 12 months ended March 2025. Further Delay in Deleveraging amid Continued Capex and Weak EBITDA: Ind-Ra had earlier factored in the management’s commitment to structure its capex plans according to cash flow generation to ensure a reduction in the net leverage below 3.5x latest by FY26. However, with the ongoing capex amid the weak profitability, the deleveraging is likely to be pushed by another year. The management is undertaking the second phase expansion capex at ACL, with a cost of INR4,700 million which entails reduction in power consumption and efficiency improvement, coupled with an increase in the clinker capacity to 2.3mnt from 1.85mnt and the cement capacity to 3mnt from 2.25mnt which will be completed by March 2026. The said capex will be funded by a mix of term debt (INR3,000 million) and fresh fund infusion. The management has guided that it may slowdown capex and defer some portion to FY27 in case of sustained weakness in the sector. The non-deferable capex is around INR1,720 million, of which around INR450 million has been spent and the remaining may be completed by September 2025.  SCL also has various green power capacity expansions planned across various plants, which, including capacity expansion at Jeerabad unit by around 0.4mnt, amounts to INR9 billion-10 billion. With the fall in EBITDA, SCL’s gross interest coverage (EBITDA/gross interest expense) fell to 0.7x in 9MFY25 (FY24: 1.3x; FY23: 0.8x) and net leverage shot to 8.3x (5.1x; 8.4x). Ind-Ra expects the interest coverage to have remained below 1.0x in FY25; although it expects a gradual improvement over FY26-FY27 contingent upon EBITDA improvement and external liquidity infusion to pare debt. After improving to 1.5x in FY21 (FY20: 2.7x), SCL’s net leverage (net debt/EBITDA) rose to 4.9x in FY22 and further to 8.5x in FY23, mainly due to the investment of INR9.2 billion towards the acquisition of ACL (acquisition value, restart capex and working capital, other costs) and completion of the Jajpur and Jeerabad plants, exacerbated by a fall in EBITDA (FY23: INR1,532 million, FY22: INR2,758 million). While the net leverage improved to 5.2x in FY24, is it is likely to have deteriorated in FY25. Liquidity Stretched: The weak performance has also led to a reduction in headroom in SCL's liquidity cushion with the likelihood of the entity requiring external funding to support its debt servicing obligations in FY26. Also, if the recent price hikes do not sustain, it could lead to a weaker-than-expected EBITDA and consequently impact the liquidity. Ind-Ra takes some comfort from the liquidity of around INR1.4 billion available at FYE25, aided by the release of working capital in 4QFY25 and fund infusion from the promoters. SCL has scheduled debt repayment obligations of around INR1.4 billion, each, in FY26 and FY27 in addition to the interest obligation of INR1.8 billion-1.9 billion and INR2.1 billion-2.2 billion, respectively, for which the entity may require external funding support. The management is undertaking measures including monetisation of non-core assets and capital raise to improve liquidity and credit metrics, and has also communicated to Ind-Ra of its commitment to inject liquidity to ensure timely servicing of obligations, if needed. The management also plans to pump in funds through promoter entities, along with the dilution of non-core assets and a reduction in the promoter holding in ACL to 75%, in line with the listing requirements to be done before March 2026. Ind-Ra will continue to closely monitor the profitability and liquidity position of the entity. At the consolidated level, SCL’s total cash and cash equivalents stood at INR1.65 billion at FYE25 (FYE24: INR2.6 billion), which includes a free cash balance of INR0.7 billion, a debt service reserve account of INR0.3 billion and INR0.6 billion towards margin money for non-fund-based limits. On a consolidated basis, the average utilisation of the fund-based and non-fund-based limits was around 86% and 82%, respectively, over the 12 months ended March 2025, indicating a moderate liquidity cushion. At the standalone level, SCL's utilisation of fund-based and non-fund-based limits was around 89% and 91%, respectively, over the same period. SCMPL has sanctioned working capital limits of INR1,100 million (fund-based limits: INR350 million with utilisation of 50% over the 12 months ended March 2025; non-fund-based limits: INR750 million, around 77%). ACL’s average use of INR45 million fund-based working capital limits was 86% and non-fund-based limits of INR60 million was 54% over the 12 months ended March 2025. SCL's cash flow from operations turned positive to INR1,833 million in FY24 (FY23: negative INR584 million; FY22: INR40 million), driven by higher EBITDA and the release of working capital. During 9MFY25, there was a slight increase in working capital, which normalised in 4QFY24 according to management. However, a lower-than-expected EBITDA and existing term debt has put pressure on the company's liquidity, leaving a thin cushion. Rating Sensitivities Positive: A sustained ramp-up in standalone volumes and operating profitability, leading to the strengthening of linkages with the parent or a revision in SCL’s Outlook would lead to the revision in ACL’s Outlook to Stable.Negative: Any deterioration in SCL’s consolidated credit profile and/or a delay in ramp-up of volumes and profitability and/or any weakening of the linkages between SCL and ACL could lead to a negative rating action. Any Other Information Standalone Performance: The company was not operational during FY20-FY23 and it resumed operations only in 1QFY24. At the standalone level, ACL reported revenue of INR2,681 million in FY24, and EBITDA losses of INR32 million. During 9MFY25, ACL reported revenue of INR1,846 million of revenue and EBITA losses of INR240 million. About the Company ACL previously manufactured cement at Durga Cement Works, which is located at Dachepallu, Guntur, Andhra Pradesh.

Rationale and key rating drivers
CARE Ratings Ltd. had, vide its press release dated November 10, 2023, placed the rating(s) of Navkar Urbanstructure Limited
(NUL) under the ‘issuer non-cooperating’ category as NUL had failed to provide information for monitoring of the rating as
agreed to in its Rating Agreement. NUL continues to be non-cooperative despite repeated requests for submission of
information through e-mails dated September 25, 2024, October 05, 2024 and October 15, 2024 among others.
In line with the extant SEBI guidelines, CARE Ratings Ltd. has reviewed the rating on the basis of the best available information
which however, in CARE Ratings Ltd.’s opinion is not sufficient to arrive at a fair rating.
Users of this rating (including investors, lenders and the public at large) are hence requested to exercise caution
while using the above rating(s).
Analytical approach: Standalone
Outlook: Stable

sources. CARE Ratings does not, however, guarantee the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of any information and is not responsible for any errors or omissions

Rating Rationale Rating Rationale November 29, 2024 | Mumbai Accuracy Shipping Limited'CRISIL BBB-/Stable' assigned to Bank Debt Rating ActionTotal Bank Loan Facilities RatedRs.128 CroreLong Term RatingCRISIL BBB-/Stable (Assigned)Note: None of the Directors on CRISIL Ratings Limited’s Board are members of rating committee and thus do not participate in discussion or assignment of any ratings. The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities Detailed Rationale CRISIL Ratings has assigned its ‘CRISIL BBB-/Stable’ rating to the long term bank facilities of Accuracy Shipping Ltd (ASL). The rating reflects the extensive experience of the promoters in the logistics industry, prudent working capital management and moderate financial profile. These strengths are partially offset by ASL's dependence on the logistics industry and susceptibility of operating margin to volatile fuel prices. Analytical Approach CRISIL Ratings has evaluated the standalone business and financial risk profiles of ASL. Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description Strengths: Extensive industry experience of the promoters: The promoters have experience of over two decades in the logistics industry. This has given them a strong understanding of the market dynamics and enabled them to establish healthy relationships with suppliers and customers. ASL has strong customer base, more than 400 trucks, 14 branches across India and over 72 agency agreements to ship around the world. Due to the extensive experience of the promoters, containers handled increased in the last five years, from 69,102 in fiscal 2020 to 115,221 in fiscal 2024. The commercial vehicle business, which started in January 2022, has picked up over the last two years and reported revenue of ~Rs 193.0 crore in fiscal 2024 (against Rs 204.0 crore in fiscal 2023). Prudent working capital management: Gross current assets were 86-105 days over the three fiscals ended March 31, 2024. The company provides a credit period of 60-90 days to transport customers and must carry inventory for 30 days for the commercial vehicle sale business. Although in some cases the company has to provide advance to shipping vessel owners and original equipment manufacturers of commercial vehicles. Moderate financial profile: ASL’s capital structure has been moderately healthy because of limited reliance on external funds yielding gearing of 0.99 time and total outside liabilities to adjusted networth (TOLANW) ratio of 1.46 times as on March 31, 2024. ASL’s debt protection metrics have also been comfortable, despite leverage, due to moderately healthy profitability. The interest coverage and net cash accrual to total debt (NCATD) ratios were 1.42 times and 0.04 time, respectively, for fiscal 2024. ASL’s debt protection metrics are expected to remain at a similar level over the medium term. Weaknesses: Operating margin susceptible to intense competition: ASL’s operating margin is expected to reduce from ~8% in fiscal 2021 to ~5% in fiscal 2025 for the logistics division as the company operates in a highly fragmented industry which has several players. Furthermore, the company’s business is directly linked to national trade and any economic slowdown could result in a steep fall in trade and negatively impact the business by exerting pressure on profitability. The industry is affected by factors such as macroeconomic growth, inflation and state of infrastructure. These factors impact both the demand and cost structure of the industry. Therefore, revenue and operating margin will remain susceptible to the level of economic activity in India and the world. Susceptibility to volatility in freight volume, which is inherently linked to global economic cycles: The freight industry is tied to economic cycles and in the case of a slowdown, the freight volume may vary. The company's performance will remain linked to end-user industries. Although containers handled increased on-year from 80,971 in fiscal 2022 to 115,221 in fiscal 2024, the topline decreased from ~ Rs 824.0 crore to ~ Rs 708.0 crore in fiscal 2024 due to decrease in freight rates. Sluggishness in Indian export-import trade, in case of a steep fall in global trade, could impact rates and profitability. Since the company has limited bargaining power against large shipping carriers, its margin is expected to remain moderate. Liquidity: Adequate Bank limit utilisation was high at 97.13% on average for the 14 months ended September 30, 2024. Cash accrual is expected to be over Rs 24 crore per annum, which will be sufficient against yearly term debt obligation of Rs 15.72 crore over the medium term, and the surplus will cushion the liquidity of the company. The current ratio was healthy at 1.6 times as on March 31, 2024. Outlook: Stable CRISIL Ratings believes ASL will continue to benefit from the extensive experience of its promoters and established relationships with clients. Rating sensitivity factors Upward factors Sustained increase in scale of operations and improved operating margin to 6% Better working capital cycle, with gross current assets improving to 70 days Downward factors Decline in operating margin to below 3% Substantial increase in working capital requirement, weakening liquidity and financial profiles About the Company ASL, formerly Accuracy Shipping Pvt Ltd, was incorporated in 2008. Subsequently the company was reconstituted as a public limited company in 2018. It provides customised and end-to-end logistics solutions and services including transportation, distribution, freight forwarding, clearing and forwarding services, custom house clearance, warehousing and other value-added services.

Details of Facilities/Instruments are in Annexure 1. Facility wise lender details are at
Annexure 2. Detailed explanation of covenants is at Annexure 3.
Detailed Rationale
As on 31 March 2025, CIFL has got fresh sanctions and there is also reduction in term loans
due to periodic repayments. Accordingly, the proposed and outstanding limits/instruments
have been reclassified at the request of the company.
The rating reaffirmation assigned to bank loan facilities and NCDs continues to derive comfort
from the comfortable capitalisation levels, sustained growth in AUM levels, diversified revenue
streams and experienced promoters and management. However, the rating strengths are
partially offset by average asset quality and inherent risks associated with MSME lending
coupled with intense competition.
Infomerics has assigned “Stable” outlook on the expectation of growth in overall financial
profile of the company in the near to medium term given the comfortable capitalisation and
established track record of the company.
1
Key Rating Sensitivities:
Upward Factors
• Substantial and sustained growth in scale of operations while maintaining comfortable
capitalisation, healthy asset quality, liquidity and profitability.
Downward Factors
• Substantial decline in scale of operations, capitalisation levels, profitability and asset
quality from the current levels.
List of Key Rating Drivers with Detailed Description
Key Rating Strengths
Comfortable capitalisation levels
CIFLs capitalisation remains comfortable with total Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets Ratio
(CRAR) of 36.63% as on 31 December 2024 (36.58% in FY24 (period refers from 01st April
2023 to 31st March 2024)) as against the minimum regulatory requirement of 15%. CIFL has
strong net worth of Rs 618.69 crore and low gearing of 1.03x as on 31 December 2024. The
capitalisation levels are expected to further improve on the back of the stake sale in its
subsidiary “Capital India Home Loans Ltd” (CIHL). CIFL holds 99.82% stake in CIHL and has
entered into “Share Purchase Agreement” on 16 October 2024 for selling its stake to “Weaver
Services Private Limited” for a consideration of Rs 267 crore. The said stake sale is subject to
Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) approval.
Sustained growth in MSME AUM
CIFLs MSME AUM has witnessed a sustained growth in last three years on the back of change
in business model. Prior to FY20, CIFL was majorly focusing on wholesale lending and given
the risks associated with wholesale/corporate lending, the company changed its business
model and forayed into “MSME” segment. Due to which, the proportion of wholesale/corporate
loans (Real estate, business loans and other loans to NBFCs/HFCs) reduced to 9% of total
AUM in 9MFY25 from 93% of total AUM in FY20. Given the rebalancing of portfolio towards
MSME segment, the AUM growth was stagnant in the last 3 years and currently stands at Rs
922.19 crore as on 31 December 2024 (Rs 913.04 crore in FY24).
Diversified revenue stream and strong earning profile
2
Capital India Finance Ltd (CIFL) is a non-deposit taking middle-layer non-banking financial
company (NBFC) registered with the Reserve Bank of India and holds AD-II license from RBI
for money changing business. CIFL has two revenue sources, income from lending activity
and income from forex services. During 9MFY25, Income from lending operations stood at
~87% and income from forex services stood at ~13%.
CIFLs earnings profile has consistently improved in the last three years with total income
increasing from Rs 122.76 crore in FY22 to Rs 194.66 crore in FY24. The increase is majorly
on account of sustainable increase of income from lending business and income from forex
services. Profitability of the company remains stable with Net Interest Margin (NIM) of 6.38%
for FY24 (6.29% in FY23). Infomerics expects that the earnings profile of the company to
improve substantially in the projected period given the strong capitalisation and further
expected capital inflows from stake sale in subsidiary.
Experienced promoters and management
Capital Group is promoted by Mr. Sumit K Narwar, a first-generation entrepreneur, who has
mentored and built businesses in Fintech and Financial services space. He currently serves
as the Chairman of Capital India Corp Private Limited (CICPL), which holds around 73% stake
in CIFL. CICPL is a core investment company registered with RBI and is the promoter entity
of Capital India Finance Limited (CIFL) an NBFC, Capital India Home Loans Ltd (CIHL), an
HFC and RapiPay Fintech Pvt Ltd (PPI license from RBI and Neo Bank). CIFL is led by Mr.
Keshav Porwal (Managing Director) and Mr. Pinank Shah (CEO), each having an experience
of more than two decades in financial services.
Key Rating Weaknesses
Average Asset quality
Given the strategic decision of the management to shift from wholesale lending to MSME
lending post 2020, the MSME loan book which was built in last 3-4 years constituting to ~82%
of AUM remains unseasoned. Hence, till FY23, GNPA levels were negligible and once the
portfolio started seasoning the GNPA levels increased in FY24 and then moderated in
9MFY25 coupled with fresh slippages from unsecured loan book (~15% of AUM), the asset
quality deteriorated with GNPA and NNPA increasing to 1.80% and 0.82% respectively in
3
FY24. However, the asset quality is expected to further moderate with seasoning of portfolio
as reflected in GNPA and NNPA numbers for 9MFY25 which stood at 1.86% and 0.93%
respectively.
Going forward, the ability of the company to improve and maintain healthy asset quality amidst
growing AUM levels will be a key rating monitorable.
Inherent risks associated with MSME lending coupled with intense competition
CIFL majorly caters to the MSME segment, which is highly vulnerable to downward economic
cycles given the low cash flow buffers. Further, the entire ~82% of AUM represents MSME
loans, with ~17% of loans falling under 1-90 buckets. The MSME industry is vulnerable to
lower economic growth, macro-economic conditions and operational risks, which could
adversely impact the company’s operations and thus its financial position. CIFL also faces
severe competition by other NBFCs and Banks.

Detailed Rationale
Infomerics Valuation and Rating Private Limited (IVR) has reaffirmed/assigned long term
rating to IVR BBB with revision in outlook to Positive from Stable outlook for the bank loan
facilities of RKEC Projects Limited (RPL).
The rating continues to draw comfort from the established track record of operations and
experienced management, demonstrated track record with proven project execution
capability, reputed clientele, healthy order book, improved debt protection metrics and
financial risk profile. However, these strengths are partially offset by tender based nature of
business, working capital intensive nature of operations and susceptibility of operating
margin to volatile input prices.
The ‘Positive’ outlook indicates improvement in scale of operations and profitability which
likely to sustain. IVR believes RPL’s will continue to benefit from its operational track record
in the business, its reputed clientele and inflow of orders as per the current order book
position.
IVR has principally relied on the standalone audited financial results of RPL upto 31 March
2024 (refers to period April 1st, 2023, to March 31, 2024), and projected financials for
FY2025, FY2026 and FY2027, and publicly available information/ clarifications provided by
the company’s management.
1
Key Rating Sensitivities:
Upward Factors
• Substantial improvement in the scale of operations with TOI above Rs. 500 crore
and EBITDA margins
• Improvement in debt protection metrics
• Sustenance of the overall gearing below.
Downward Factors
• Significant reduction in the scale of operations and profitability margins,
• Deterioration in debt protection metrics and overall gearing
• Low orders inflow or delay in execution of projects
List of Key Rating Drivers with Detailed Description
Key Rating Strengths
• Established track record of operations and experienced management:
The company commenced its operations in 2005 and has a successful track record of
around of more than 15 years in the existing line of business. Overall activities of RPL
are managed by Garapati Radhakrishna (Chairman cum Director) who has more than
three decades of experience in current line of business. He is ably supported by other
two directors namely Ms. Garapati Parvathi Devi and Garapati Ram Mohan. These
directors are ably supported by qualified and well experienced management team. Over
the years they have built strong relationships with customers and suppliers.
• Demonstrated track record with proven project execution capability:
RPL has long track record of more than a decade in EPC segment. Over the years of its
operation the company has gradually established its credentials and successfully
executed many projects. In order to manage the projects in a better way and to grow in a
balanced way, the company has a policy to take up short to medium term projects (18-36
months) and handle limited number of projects at a time to ensure timely completion.
The repeat orders received from its clientele validate its execution capabilities.
• Reputed clientele:
The company is dealing with government and private clients namely, Military Engineering
Services, Director General Navy Projects, Public Welfare Department, Adani Infra India
Limited, Vishakhapatnam Smart City Cooperation and various ports like Haldia Port
Trust, Visakhapatnam Port Trust, Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, Cochin Port Trust etc.
The company has been associated with most of the key clients for a long time, and the
successful execution of the projects has also helped it in getting repeat orders. Due to
reputed client profiles, the company has low counterparty credit risk although at times,
there can be delays in the realization of some bills.
2
• Healthy order book:
The company has a healthy unexecuted order book position to the tune of about Rs.
915.14 crore which is to be executed within 2-3 years, thereby providing a moderate
revenue visibility over medium term.
• Improved debt protection metrics and financial risk profile:
In terms of the debt coverage indicators, the interest service coverage ratio (ISCR) and
the debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) improved to at 3.24x and 2.24x respectively in
FY2024 from 2.96x and 1.79x respectively in FY2023. The tangible networth improved to
Rs. 168.43 crore in FY2024 from Rs. 148.10 crore in FY2023. The overall gearing stood
comfortable at 0.71x in FY2024. The total operating income (TOI) improved by ~13.71%
to Rs. 341.09 crore in FY2024 from Rs. 299.97 crore in FY2023.
Key Rating Weaknesses
• Working capital intensive nature of operations:
RPL’s operations are working capital intensive in nature, supported largely by bank
borrowings. The average utilisation of fund based and non-fund based working capital
limits of the company stood high around ~81.53% and ~78.31% respectively during the
last 12 months ending 31st May 2024.
• Tender based nature of business:
The company is mostly getting its orders through tenders floated by various government
departments. As the infrastructure industry is highly fragmented due to presence of many
organized and unorganized players tender driven nature of business leads to volatility in
revenue and profitability. Further, being in infrastructure segment the company is
exposed to inherent risks associated in this industry like slowdown in new order inflows,
risks of delays in execution etc.
• Susceptibility of operating margin to volatile input prices:
The company’s operating margins are susceptible to volatility in prices of raw materials,
although the same risk has been mitigated to some extent with the presence of price
escalation clause.
Analytical Approach: For arriving at the ratings, IVR has analysed RPL’s credit profile by
considering the standalone financial statements of the company.

29.26 crore in FY2024. The company projected to generate cash accruals of Rs. 34.20 crore
in FY2025 against a CPLTD of Rs. 11.29 crore. With the adequate expected cash accruals

Rating Rationale Rating Rationale May 07, 2025 | Mumbai Chandan Healthcare Limited Rating migrated to 'Crisil BBB-/Stable' Rating Action Total Bank Loan Facilities Rated Rs.20 Crore Long Term Rating Crisil BBB-/Stable (Migrated from 'Crisil BB-/Stable ISSUER NOT COOPERATING*') Note: None of the Directors on Crisil Ratings Limited’s Board are members of rating committee and thus do not participate in discussion or assignment of any ratings. The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings. 1 crore = 10 million Refer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities *Issuer did not cooperate; based on best-available information Detailed Rationale Due to inadequate information and in line with the Securities and Exchange Board of India guidelines, Crisil Ratings had migrated its rating on the long-term bank facilities of Chandan Healthcare Limited (CHL) to ‘Crisil BB-/Stable Issuer Not Cooperating’. However, the management has subsequently started sharing requisite information, necessary for carrying out comprehensive review of the rating. Consequently, Crisil Ratings is migrating the rating on bank facilities of CHL to ‘Crisil BBB-/Stable’ from ‘Crisil BB-/Stable Issuer Not Cooperating' The rating continues to reflect the extensive experience of the promoter in the healthcare industry, and the moderate financial risk profile of the company. These strengths are partially offset by working capital-intensive operations and limited track record of sustenance of operating profitability. Analytical Approach Crisil Ratings has combined the business and financial risk profiles of CHL, Chandan Pharmacy Ltd (CPL) and Indra Diagnostic Centre & Blood Bank Ltd (IDCBBL). This is because IDCBBL is a wholly owned subsidiary of CHL and the latter holds 53% stake in CPL. Please refer Annexure - List of Entities Consolidated, which captures the list of entities considered and their analytical treatment of consolidation Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description Strengths: Extensive experience of the promoter: The three-decade-long experience of the promoter in the healthcare industry, their strong understanding of market dynamics and established relationships with suppliers and customers, will continue to support the business risk profile. This has aided sustained improvement in the business risk profile of CHL, supported by steady growth in revenue and operating margin. Revenue recorded a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24% over the three fiscals ended March 31, 2024, and is projected to show a further year on year growth of 30-35% to around Rs 215-225 crore during fiscal 2025; revenue is estimated to be around Rs 167 crore till December 2024. Revenue growth will be aided by expansion of network and the addition of new customers. Further, the operating margin is expected to sustain around 15-16% in fiscal 2025, backed by healthy collections at new centers. In March-2025, the group acquired X-Life diagnostics for Rs 6.75 crore which owned a diagnostic center at a prime location in Patna, Bihar which is running profitably. Management is targeting to open 3 additional centers each year in order to continuously grow and expand its reach. Sustained improvement in the scale of operations while sustaining healthy margins amid expansion of the network would remain monitorable Healthy financial risk profile: The financial risk profile is marked by moderate networth and gearing projected to be in the range of Rs 135-140 crore and below 0.4 time, respectively, as on March 31, 2025, as against Rs 44 crore and 0.95 time, respectively, a year before. Improvement in networth will be supported by funds raised through the IPO, amounting to Rs 107 crore in February 2025, and steady accretion to reserves. The sustaining operating margin and limited dependence on bank debt kept debt protection indicators healthy, with interest coverage projected to be 8-9 times for fiscal 2025. In the absence of any debt-funded capital expenditure plans, the financial risk profile is expected to remain comfortable over the medium term. Weaknesses: Working capital-intensive operations: Gross current assets (GCAs) stood at 119 days as on March 31, 2024, driven by receivables of 58 days and inventory of 47 days. GCA days are likely to remain around 100-110 days over the medium term, as payments from government departments under the National Health Mission, are generally received within 60-90 days. This has led to higher working capital requirement and higher utilization of bank lines, however, post fundraising in Feb-2025, the same has been moderated. Going forward, efficient working capital management, leading to moderation in bank limit utilization, will be a key monitorable. Liquidity: Adequate Bank limit utilization is around 78 percent for the past twelve months ending March-2025. Cash accrual are expected to be over Rs 20-28 crore which are sufficient against term debt obligation of Rs 5-7 crore over the medium term. In addition, will act as a cushion to the liquidity of the company. The current ratio is around 0.8 times on March 31, 2024. The promoters are likely to extend support in the form of equity and unsecured loans to meet its working capital requirements and repayment obligations. Outlook: Stable Crisil Ratings believes CHL will continue to benefit from the extensive experience of its promoter in the healthcare industry and established relationships with clients. Rating Sensitivity Factors Upward factors: Sustained growth in operating income and sustenance of operating margin over 14-15% leading to higher-than-expected net cash accruals Efficient working capital management Downward factors: Decline in scale of operations or operating margin below 9-10%, leading to lower-than-expected net cash accruals Stretch in working capital cycle leading to weakening of financial and liquidity profiles About the Group Incorporated in 2003, CHL provides diagnostic services related to radiology, pathology, cardiology, health check-ups, electromyogram, electroencephalogram, audiometry, endoscopy, pulmonary function test, allergies, auditory brainstem response, electromyography, nerve conduction velocity and bone mineral density. The company also operates pharmacies and a blood bank. Promoted by Dr Amar Singh, CHL is present in Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Uttarakhand. CPL, incorporated in 2018, trades in medicines and owns and runs retail pharmacy units, with more than 50% stake held by CHL. IDCBBL runs a diagnostic centre Agra and Gorakhpur.

RATING ACTION / OUTLOOK / NATURE OF NON-COOPERATION Brickwork Ratings (BWR) has downgraded the ratings at ‘BWR BB+/Stable/BWR A4+’ for the bank loan facilities of Tarmat Ltd. The rating has also been classified under the ‘ISSUER NOT COOPERATING category. The ratings are due for review in Feb 2024, BWR took up with the company recently over emails and through telephone calls to obtain the required information. Despite the best efforts of BWR to get at least the minimum required information for a review, the entity has not provided the same. Thus, due to lack of management cooperation to furnish adequate information about the company's performance despite follow up, BWR is unable to assess its financial performance or its ability to service its debt and maintain a valid rating. Accordingly, the ratings have been downgraded and migratated in the “Issuer Not Cooperating” category. The rating downgrade is based on the lack of up-to-date information on the company’s performance. The lenders/investors may note to exercise due caution while using the above rating which mentions "Issuer Not Cooperating" since the rating lack any projections or forward looking component as it is arrived at based on the best available information without any management/banker's interaction. LIMITATIONS OF THE RATING Information availability risk is a key factor in the assessment of credit risk as generally, non-cooperation by the rated entities to provide the required information for a review of the assigned rating may also be accompanied by financial stress. Users of the credit rating should, therefore, take into account the possible deterioration in the credit quality of the rated entity arising from its non-transparency and withholdings of the information required for a review of the rating.

Rating Rationale Rating Rationale November 19, 2024 | Mumbai Viceroy HotelsRating reaffirmed at 'CRISIL BB-/Stable' Rating ActionTotal Bank Loan Facilities RatedRs.24.5 CroreLong Term RatingCRISIL BB-/Stable (Reaffirmed)Note: None of the Directors on CRISIL Ratings Limited’s Board are members of rating committee and thus do not participate in discussion or assignment of any ratings. The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities Detailed rationale CRISIL Ratings has reaffirmed its ‘CRISIL BB-/Stable’ rating on the long term bank facilities of Viceroy Hotels (VH). The ratings reflect the extensive industry experience of the partners of VH. These strengths are partially offset by the geographic concentration in revenue profile and weakened financial risk profile. Analytical approach CRISIL Ratings has evaluated the standalone business and financial risk profiles of VH. Key rating drivers and detailed description Strength: Extensive industry experience of the partners: The partners have experience of over four decades in the hotels and resorts industry. This has given them an understanding of the dynamics of the market and enabled them to establish relationships with suppliers and customers. Weaknesses: Vulnerability to cyclicality in the hospitality industry: The hotel industry is vulnerable to changes in the domestic and international economies. Typically, the industry follows a six-year cycle. Companies which have a high financial leverage are more vulnerable to cyclicality due to their fixed financial commitments. Weakened financial risk profile: The financial risk profile of the firm is marked by a weak capital structure and moderate debt protection metrics. Networth was about Rs 5.42 crore as on March 31, 2024. Gearing was significantly high at 6.23 times as on March 31, 2024, driven by large debt. Debt protection metrics are also moderate as reflected in interest coverage and net cash accrual to total debt ratios of 2.55 times and 0.05 time, respectively, in fiscal 2024. Liquidity: Stretched Bank limit utilisation averaged a high 92% for the 12 months ended September 2024. Expected cash accrual of Rs 3.90-4.50 crore are tightly matched term against debt obligation of Rs 3-4 crore over the medium term. Current ratio was low at 0.64 time as on March 31, 2024. The partners have withdrawn Rs 2.32 crore in fiscal 2024, which resulted in a decline in the networth. Cash and bank balance was moderate around Rs 74 lakh as on March 31, 2024. Outlook: Stable CRISIL Ratings believes VH will continue to benefit from the extensive experience of its partners, and established relationships with clients. Rating sensitivity factors Upward factors Substantial and sustainable increase in revenue and profitability, leading to cash accrual of Rs 5 crore Gearing improving to below 3 times.

The instrument-wise rating actions are as follows: Details of Instruments Instrument Type Date of Issuance Coupon Rate Maturity Date Size of Issue (million) Rating assigned along with Outlook/Watch Rating Action Fund-based working capital limits---INR100IND BBB/NegativeAssignedProposed term loan--31 December 2033INR1,500IND BBB/NegativeAssignedTerm loan--31 December 2033INR1,500IND BBB/NegativeAssignedTerm loan--31 December 2033INR5,819.70 (reduced from INR5,999.80)IND BBB/NegativeDowngradedNon-fund-based working capital limits---INR600IND BBB/Negative/IND A3+DowngradedFund-based working capital limits---INR350IND BBB/NegativeDowngradedAnalytical Approach Ind-Ra continues to take a top-down approach under its Parent Subsidiary Linkage Rating Criteria to arrive at ACL’s rating, given the strong linkages between ACL and its parent, Sagar Cements Limited (SCL; ‘IND BBB+’/Negative), which acquired ACL in March 2023. Detailed Rationale of the Rating Action The downgrade reflects the likelihood of SCL’s performance being significantly weaker-than-Ind-Ra’s expectation over FY25-FY26 with a lower EBITDA generation leading to higher net debt levels and reduced liquidity cushion. With the sharp fall in cement prices in FY25, Ind-Ra expects SCL’s EBITDA/metric tonne (mt) to have declined in FY25, which coupled with flattish volumes, is likely to have resulted in a significant decline in the EBITDA, against its earlier expectations of some recovery. However, Ind-Ra expects the sale volumes to improve in FY26 led by an improvement in infrastructure demand in the region as well as completion of capex at its subsidiary ACL by 1HFYE26. After witnessing the sharpest fall in prices in the last decade, Ind-Ra expects cement prices to witness some stability and improvement in FY26, which could improve SCL’s profitability. However, notwithstanding some improvement, Ind-Ra expects SCL’s EBITDA to remain significantly lower than its earlier expectations in FY26.  Ind-Ra had earlier factored in the management’s commitment to structure its capex plans according to cash flow generation to ensure a reduction in the net leverage (net debt/operating EBITDA) below 3.5x latest by FY26. However, with the ongoing capex amid the weak profitability, the deleveraging is likely to be pushed by another year. The weak performance has also reduced the headroom in SCL's liquidity cushion with the likelihood of the entity requiring external funding to support its debt servicing obligations in FY26. The Negative Outlook reflects the potential risk to SCL’s liquidity and deleveraging if the recent price hikes do not sustain, leading to a weaker-than-expected EBITDA in FY26. Although, Ind-Ra takes some comfort from the liquidity of around INR1.4 billion (including unrestricted cash of INR0.7 billion and unused drawable working limits of INR0.7 billion) available at end-March 2025, aided by the working capital release in 4QFY25 and fund infusion in the form of unsecured loans from the promoters. Furthermore, the management is undertaking measures including monetisation of non-core assets and capital raise to improve liquidity and credit metrics, and has also communicated to Ind-Ra of its commitment to inject liquidity into the entity to ensure timely servicing of obligations, if needed. Ind-Ra will continue to closely monitor the profitability and liquidity position of the entity. Ind-Ra continues to draw comfort from SCL's comfortable market position in the cement industry and its geographically diversified operations across three regions. The promoters have over four decades of experience in the cement industry. List of Key Rating Drivers Strengths- Strong linkages with parent - Comfortable market position, likely to improve with capex completion- Geographically diversified with presence in three regions- Adequate raw material linkages and captive power Weaknesses- EBITDA likely to remain weaker-than-expected despite some recovery in FY26- Reduction in liquidity cushion - Further delays in deleveraging amid continued capex and weak EBITDA Detailed Description of Key Rating Drivers Strong Linkages with Parent: Ind-Ra believes the linkages between ACL and SCL to be strong due to operational synergies and ACL’s strategic importance to SCL. This is evident from the significant equity investment and unsecured loans provided by SCL/promoters, along with their commitment to offer further financial and operational support as needed. SCL’s loans and advances to ACL rose to INR0.7 billion at end-December 2024 (FY23: INR0.2 billion) in addition to the investment of INR3.1 billion made in FY23. Furthermore, majority of the capex at the consolidated level is focused on ACL’s capacity expansion, with ACL’s EBITDA contribution likely to rise to 10%-12% in the near term, thus increasing its importance within the group. ACL has also become the key driver of the group’s financial profile given ramp-up of volumes and EBITDA turnaround is critical for SCL’s deleveraging. The acquisition of ACL has enabled SCL to scale up its capacity to 10.5 million tonnes (mnt) as of FY24, which will further increase to 11.25mnt by FY26 with the ongoing capex. This expansion will strengthen SCL’s market position in the southern regions of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, making ACL strategically important to SCL. ACL currently accounts for about 21% of SCL’s consolidated cement capacity, which will rise to approximately 27% post the completion of the ongoing capex. Operational synergies persist as ACL utilises SCL’s marketing network and sells cement under the common brand Sagar, with centralised procurement of raw materials. Ind-Ra believes these strategic linkages will strengthen over time as ACL begins generating significant EBITDA and contributing to the consolidated cash flows. ACL was acquired by SCL through the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code route in March 2023 at a cost of INR9,220 million, including a start-up capex of INR850 million, and working capital and other costs of INR 750 million. The acquisition was funded by term debt of INR 6,000 million, with the balance funded by SCL. According to the resolution plan approved by the National Company Law Tribunal on 16 February 2023, SCL held a 95% stake in ACL, with the remaining stake being held by retail investors. SCL’s management has reduced its stake to 90% and plans to further dilute 15% before December 2025 to comply with the listing regulations. ACL’s board is represented by SCL’s management and common independent directors, with centralised treasury operations. Comfortable Market Position, Likely to Improve with Capex Completion: SCL’s capacity increased by over 80% to 10.5mnt over FY21-FY24 due to a combination of organic and inorganic growth. After completing greenfield projects in Odisha and Madhya Pradesh in 2HFY22, SCL acquired ACL in March 2023. This capacity expansion has strengthened SCL's business profile by improving its market position and geographical presence. The management plans to further increase the capacity to 11.25mnt over the next couple of years with the capex completion at ACL and further to 11.65mnt with the grinding expansion at SCMPL, depending on market conditions and cash flows. Geographically Diversified with Presence in Three Regions: While SCL remained a south focused entity until FY21, the company has expanded its manufacturing presence in central and eastern regions, which have high growth potential. SCL's concentration in the southern region has been decreasing (FY24: 70%, FY23: 75%). In FY24, Andhra Pradesh accounted for 29% of the cement sales, Telangana 24%, Tamil Nadu 10%, and Karnataka 7%. Management expects Telangana (50% of sales mix in FY24), Andhra Pradesh (30%), and Tamil Nadu (20%) to be the key markets for ACL. The infrastructure spending remained weak in FY25 with the general elections leading to subdued demand. Ind-Ra believes the development of Andhra Pradesh's new capital, Amravati, along with increased budget allocations for essential infrastructure such as water, power, railways, and roads over the medium term, is likely to support cement demand in the southern region. Adequate Raw Material Linkages and Captive Power:  Following the ACL acquisition, SCL has consolidated limestone reserves of approximately 944mt, sufficient to meet the medium-to-long-term limestone needs of its existing plants. SCL is also developing feeders for alternative fuel consumption across all its plants, allowing flexibility in fuel choice based on availability and cost. At the consolidated level, SCL has a 73MW captive thermal power generation capacity, a 14.1MW-waste heat recovery plant, and around 16MW of solar and hydro power plants, which are sufficient to meet the power requirements of the entities, including the new capacities being added. The company has also managed to reduce its lead distance by about 38% over FY17-FY24 (FY24: 4%; FY23: 8%). EBITDA Likely to Remain Weaker-than-Expected despite Some Recovery in FY26: SCL’s volumes are likely to have remained flattish in FY25, given the slowdown in demand (9MFY25: down 2% yoy); Ind-Ra expects the sales volume to improve in FY26 backed by infrastructure spending and the completion of ACL capex. The muted demand and sizeable capacity additions resulted in a decadal high fall in prices in FY25, leading to a fall in EBITDA/mt to INR273 in 9MFY25 (9MFY24: INR456). Ind-Ra understands that prices have improved in April 2025 but the sustainability remains a monitorable, given the influx of capacities and a high competitive intensity. Ind-Ra believes the completion of ACL capex plan, along with planned efficiency improvements will enhance the plant’s cost structure, leading to higher margins and better cash generation. ACL recorded sales volume of around 0.5mt in FY24and EBITDA losses of INR32 million. The gradual ramp up of output at ACL post the expanded capacities kick in, coupled with operational efficiencies and fixed-cost absorption is likely to result in improved operational EBITDA at the consolidated level. As a result, while some improvement is likely in FY26, Ind-Ra believes SCL’s EBITDA/mt is likely to remain lower than its earlier expectations. Weak demand and profitability had resulted in a fall in SCL’s EBITDA to INR1 billion in 9MFY25 (9MFY24: INR1.8 billion), with only a likely marginal improvement in 4QFY25. This was against Ind-Ra’s earlier expectation of an improvement in FY25. Reduction in Liquidity Cushion: The weak performance has also reduced the headroom in SCL's liquidity cushion with the likelihood of the entity requiring external funding to support its debt servicing obligations in FY26. Also, if the recent price hikes do not sustain, it could lead to a weaker-than-expected EBITDA and consequently impact the liquidity. Ind-Ra takes some comfort from the liquidity of around INR1.4 billion available at FYE25, aided by the release of working capital in 4QFY25 and fund infusion from the promoters. SCL has scheduled debt repayment obligations of around INR1.4 billion, each, in FY26 and FY27 in addition to the interest obligation of INR1.8 billion-1.9 billion and INR2.1 billion-2.2 billion, respectively, for which the entity may require external funding support. The management is undertaking measures including monetisation of non-core assets and capital raise to improve liquidity and credit metrics, and has also communicated to Ind-Ra of its commitment to inject liquidity to ensure timely servicing of obligations, if needed. The management also plans to pump in funds through promoter entities, along with the dilution of non-core assets and a reduction in the promoter holding in ACL to 75% from the current 90%, in line with the listing requirements to be done before March 2026. Ind-Ra will continue to closely monitor the profitability and liquidity position of the entity. At the consolidated level, SCL’s total cash and cash equivalents stood at INR1.65 billion at FYE25 (FYE24: INR2.6 billion), which includes a free cash balance of INR0.7 billion, a debt service reserve account of INR0.3 billion and INR0.6 billion towards margin money for non-fund-based limits. On a consolidated basis, the average utilisation of the fund-based and non-fund-based limits was around 86% and 82%, respectively, over the 12 months ended March 2025, indicating a moderate liquidity cushion. At the standalone level, SCL's utilisation of fund-based and non-fund-based limits was around 89% and 91%, respectively, over the same period. SCMPL has sanctioned working capital limits of INR1,100 million (fund-based limits: INR350 million with utilisation of 50% over the 12 months ended March 2025; non-fund-based limits: INR750 million, around 77%). ACL’s average use of INR45 million fund-based working capital limits was 86% and non-fund-based limits of INR60 million was 54% over the 12 months ended March 2025. Further Delay in Deleveraging amid Continued Capex and Weak EBITDA: Ind-Ra had earlier factored in the management’s commitment to structure its capex plans according to cash flow generation to ensure a reduction in the net leverage below 3.5x latest by FY26. However, with the ongoing capex amid the weak profitability, the deleveraging is likely to be pushed by another year. The management is undertaking the second phase expansion capex at ACL, with a cost of INR4,700 million which entails reduction in power consumption and efficiency improvement, coupled with an increase in the clinker capacity to 2.3mnt from 1.85mnt and the cement capacity to 3mnt from 2.25mnt which will be completed by March 2026. The said capex will be funded by a mix of term debt (INR3,000 million) and fresh fund infusion. The management has guided that it may slowdown capex and defer some portion to FY27 in case of sustained weakness in the sector. The non-deferable capex is around INR1,720 million, of which around INR450 million has been spent and the remaining may be completed by September 2025.  SCL also has various green power capacity expansions planned across various plants, which, including capacity expansion at Jeerabad unit by around 0.4mnt, amounts to INR9 billion-10 billion. With the fall in EBITDA, SCL’s gross interest coverage (EBITDA/gross interest expense) fell to 0.7x in 9MFY25 (FY24: 1.3x; FY23: 0.8x) and net leverage shot to 8.3x (5.1x; 8.4x). Ind-Ra expects the interest coverage to have remained below 1.0x in FY25; although it expects a gradual improvement over FY26-FY27 contingent upon EBITDA improvement and external liquidity infusion to pare debt. After improving to 1.5x in FY21 (FY20: 2.7x), SCL’s net leverage (net debt/EBITDA) rose to 4.9x in FY22 and further to 8.5x in FY23, mainly due to the investment of INR9.2 billion towards the acquisition of ACL (acquisition value, restart capex and working capital, other costs) and completion of the Jajpur and Jeerabad plants, exacerbated by a fall in EBITDA (FY23: INR1,532 million, FY22: INR2,758 million). While the net leverage improved to 5.2x in FY24, is it is likely to have deteriorated in FY25. Liquidity Stretched: The weak performance has also led to a reduction in headroom in SCL's liquidity cushion with the likelihood of the entity requiring external funding to support its debt servicing obligations in FY26. Also, if the recent price hikes do not sustain, it could lead to a weaker-than-expected EBITDA and consequently impact the liquidity. Ind-Ra takes some comfort from the liquidity of around INR1.4 billion available at FYE25, aided by the release of working capital in 4QFY25 and fund infusion from the promoters. SCL has scheduled debt repayment obligations of around INR1.4 billion, each, in FY26 and FY27 in addition to the interest obligation of INR1.8 billion-1.9 billion and INR2.1 billion-2.2 billion, respectively, for which the entity may require external funding support. The management is undertaking measures including monetisation of non-core assets and capital raise to improve liquidity and credit metrics, and has also communicated to Ind-Ra of its commitment to inject liquidity to ensure timely servicing of obligations, if needed. The management also plans to pump in funds through promoter entities, along with the dilution of non-core assets and a reduction in the promoter holding in ACL to 75%, in line with the listing requirements to be done before March 2026. Ind-Ra will continue to closely monitor the profitability and liquidity position of the entity. At the consolidated level, SCL’s total cash and cash equivalents stood at INR1.65 billion at FYE25 (FYE24: INR2.6 billion), which includes a free cash balance of INR0.7 billion, a debt service reserve account of INR0.3 billion and INR0.6 billion towards margin money for non-fund-based limits. On a consolidated basis, the average utilisation of the fund-based and non-fund-based limits was around 86% and 82%, respectively, over the 12 months ended March 2025, indicating a moderate liquidity cushion. At the standalone level, SCL's utilisation of fund-based and non-fund-based limits was around 89% and 91%, respectively, over the same period. SCMPL has sanctioned working capital limits of INR1,100 million (fund-based limits: INR350 million with utilisation of 50% over the 12 months ended March 2025; non-fund-based limits: INR750 million, around 77%). ACL’s average use of INR45 million fund-based working capital limits was 86% and non-fund-based limits of INR60 million was 54% over the 12 months ended March 2025. SCL's cash flow from operations turned positive to INR1,833 million in FY24 (FY23: negative INR584 million; FY22: INR40 million), driven by higher EBITDA and the release of working capital. During 9MFY25, there was a slight increase in working capital, which normalised in 4QFY24 according to management. However, a lower-than-expected EBITDA and existing term debt has put pressure on the company's liquidity, leaving a thin cushion. Rating Sensitivities Positive: A sustained ramp-up in standalone volumes and operating profitability, leading to the strengthening of linkages with the parent or a revision in SCL’s Outlook would lead to the revision in ACL’s Outlook to Stable.Negative: Any deterioration in SCL’s consolidated credit profile and/or a delay in ramp-up of volumes and profitability and/or any weakening of the linkages between SCL and ACL could lead to a negative rating action. Any Other Information Standalone Performance: The company was not operational during FY20-FY23 and it resumed operations only in 1QFY24. At the standalone level, ACL reported revenue of INR2,681 million in FY24, and EBITDA losses of INR32 million. During 9MFY25, ACL reported revenue of INR1,846 million of revenue and EBITA losses of INR240 million. About the Company ACL previously manufactured cement at Durga Cement Works, which is located at Dachepallu, Guntur, Andhra Pradesh. The National Company Law Tribunal approved the resolution plan submitted by SCL for the acquisition of ACL on 16 February 2023. The resolution process was completed in March 2023. The company was not operational during FY20-FY23 but commenced operations in 1QFY24. It has a cement grinding capacity of 2.25mnt.

Rationale and key rating drivers
CARE Ratings Ltd. had, vide its press release dated November 10, 2023, placed the rating(s) of Navkar Urbanstructure Limited
(NUL) under the ‘issuer non-cooperating’ category as NUL had failed to provide information for monitoring of the rating as
agreed to in its Rating Agreement. NUL continues to be non-cooperative despite repeated requests for submission of
information through e-mails dated September 25, 2024, October 05, 2024 and October 15, 2024 among others.
In line with the extant SEBI guidelines, CARE Ratings Ltd. has reviewed the rating on the basis of the best available information
which however, in CARE Ratings Ltd.’s opinion is not sufficient to arrive at a fair rating.
Users of this rating (including investors, lenders and the public at large) are hence requested to exercise caution
while using the above rating(s).

sources. CARE Ratings does not, however, guarantee the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of any information and is not responsible for any errors or omissions

Rating Rationale Rating Rationale November 29, 2024 | Mumbai Accuracy Shipping Limited'CRISIL BBB-/Stable' assigned to Bank Debt Rating ActionTotal Bank Loan Facilities RatedRs.128 CroreLong Term RatingCRISIL BBB-/Stable (Assigned)Note: None of the Directors on CRISIL Ratings Limited’s Board are members of rating committee and thus do not participate in discussion or assignment of any ratings. The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities Detailed Rationale CRISIL Ratings has assigned its ‘CRISIL BBB-/Stable’ rating to the long term bank facilities of Accuracy Shipping Ltd (ASL). The rating reflects the extensive experience of the promoters in the logistics industry, prudent working capital management and moderate financial profile. These strengths are partially offset by ASL's dependence on the logistics industry and susceptibility of operating margin to volatile fuel prices. Analytical Approach CRISIL Ratings has evaluated the standalone business and financial risk profiles of ASL. Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description Strengths: Extensive industry experience of the promoters: The promoters have experience of over two decades in the logistics industry. This has given them a strong understanding of the market dynamics and enabled them to establish healthy relationships with suppliers and customers. ASL has strong customer base, more than 400 trucks, 14 branches across India and over 72 agency agreements to ship around the world. Due to the extensive experience of the promoters, containers handled increased in the last five years, from 69,102 in fiscal 2020 to 115,221 in fiscal 2024. The commercial vehicle business, which started in January 2022, has picked up over the last two years and reported revenue of ~Rs 193.0 crore in fiscal 2024 (against Rs 204.0 crore in fiscal 2023). Prudent working capital management: Gross current assets were 86-105 days over the three fiscals ended March 31, 2024. The company provides a credit period of 60-90 days to transport customers and must carry inventory for 30 days for the commercial vehicle sale business. Although in some cases the company has to provide advance to shipping vessel owners and original equipment manufacturers of commercial vehicles. Moderate financial profile: ASL’s capital structure has been moderately healthy because of limited reliance on external funds yielding gearing of 0.99 time and total outside liabilities to adjusted networth (TOLANW) ratio of 1.46 times as on March 31, 2024. ASL’s debt protection metrics have also been comfortable, despite leverage, due to moderately healthy profitability. The interest coverage and net cash accrual to total debt (NCATD) ratios were 1.42 times and 0.04 time, respectively, for fiscal 2024. ASL’s debt protection metrics are expected to remain at a similar level over the medium term. Weaknesses: Operating margin susceptible to intense competition: ASL’s operating margin is expected to reduce from ~8% in fiscal 2021 to ~5% in fiscal 2025 for the logistics division as the company operates in a highly fragmented industry which has several players. Furthermore, the company’s business is directly linked to national trade and any economic slowdown could result in a steep fall in trade and negatively impact the business by exerting pressure on profitability. The industry is affected by factors such as macroeconomic growth, inflation and state of infrastructure. These factors impact both the demand and cost structure of the industry. Therefore, revenue and operating margin will remain susceptible to the level of economic activity in India and the world. Susceptibility to volatility in freight volume, which is inherently linked to global economic cycles: The freight industry is tied to economic cycles and in the case of a slowdown, the freight volume may vary. The company's performance will remain linked to end-user industries. Although containers handled increased on-year from 80,971 in fiscal 2022 to 115,221 in fiscal 2024, the topline decreased from ~ Rs 824.0 crore to ~ Rs 708.0 crore in fiscal 2024 due to decrease in freight rates. Sluggishness in Indian export-import trade, in case of a steep fall in global trade, could impact rates and profitability. Since the company has limited bargaining power against large shipping carriers, its margin is expected to remain moderate. Liquidity: Adequate Bank limit utilisation was high at 97.13% on average for the 14 months ended September 30, 2024. Cash accrual is expected to be over Rs 24 crore per annum, which will be sufficient against yearly term debt obligation of Rs 15.72 crore over the medium term, and the surplus will cushion the liquidity of the company. The current ratio was healthy at 1.6 times as on March 31, 2024. Outlook: Stable CRISIL Ratings believes ASL will continue to benefit from the extensive experience of its promoters and established relationships with clients. Rating sensitivity factors Upward factors Sustained increase in scale of operations and improved operating margin to 6% Better working capital cycle, with gross current assets improving to 70 days Downward factors Decline in operating margin to below 3% Substantial increase in working capital requirement, weakening liquidity and financial profiles About the Company ASL, formerly Accuracy Shipping Pvt Ltd, was incorporated in 2008. Subsequently the company was reconstituted as a public limited company in 2018. It provides customised and end-to-end logistics solutions and services including transportation, distribution, freight forwarding, clearing and forwarding services, custom house clearance, warehousing and other value-added services.

Rating Rationale Rating Rationale May 06, 2025 | Mumbai Laxmi Goldorna House Limited'Crisil BB/Stable' assigned to Bank Debt Rating ActionTotal Bank Loan Facilities RatedRs.53 CroreLong Term RatingCrisil BB/Stable (Assigned)Note: None of the Directors on Crisil Ratings Limited’s Board are members of rating committee and thus do not participate in discussion or assignment of any ratings. The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities Detailed Rationale Crisil Ratings has assigned its ‘Crisil BB/Stable’ rating to the long-term bank facility of Laxmi Goldorna House Ltd (LGOHL, a part of the Laxmi group). The rating reflects the established market position of the company supported by the extensive experience of its promoters in the real estate industry, the comfortable financial risk profile and diversified business lines. These strengths are partially offset by susceptibility to saleability risks associated with the ongoing projects and exposure to cyclicality inherent in the Indian real estate sector. Analytical Approach Crisil Ratings has evaluated the standalone business and financial risk profiles of LGOHL. Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description Strengths: Established market position supported by the extensive industry experience of the promoters: LGOHL is a part of the Ahmedabad-based Laxmi group, a prominent and trusted developer with a healthy track record of more than a decade in the real estate business and gold and jewellery segment. The company has a healthy track record of completing projects before time and the same will remain monitorable. It has also completed a few projects without any term loan owing to the promotors’ backing. Diversified business lines: The promoters have been in the real estate and gold businesses for more than a decade through different companies. After 2017, the company started undertaking both businesses under LGOHL. The real estate business accounted for around 80% of the revenue of the company in fiscal 2024 while the remaining 20% was contributed by the gold and jewellery segment. Moderate financial risk profile: Saleability and operating profitability are comfortable in the ongoing projects. Furthermore, LGOHL’s ability to accelerate the collections through healthy sales at the launch of any project reduces the dependence on external funding. Moderate collections duly supported the debt coverage indicators with total debt (Rs 101 crore) to total assets (Rs 270-280 crore) ratio of 36% on project cost basis. It is expected to remain comfortable around similar levels over the medium term. Timely customer advances will cushion the financial risk profile of the company. Weaknesses: Exposure to risks associated with the ongoing projects: The company is executing two residential cum commercial projects, Laxmi 101 and Laxmi Courtyard with 487 residential apartments and 73 shops in Ahmedabad. Laxmi 101 has two blocks of 14 floors each and Laxmi Courtyard has 5 blocks with nine floors each. Construction is in the initial phase with 18.5% and 19.95% completed till March 2025, respectively, and the rest expected to be completed by March 2028 and June 2029, respectively. Only around 11.74% of the total units in Laxmi Courtyard have been booked, leading to modest customer advances. In Laxmi 101 no units have been booked till March 2025. Thus, the operating performance will remain susceptible to timely completion of the projects and flow of customer advances. Exposure to cyclicality inherent in the Indian real estate industry: The real estate sector in India is cyclical and affected by volatile prices, opaque transactions, and a highly fragmented market structure. Hence, the business risk profile will remain susceptible to risks arising from any industry slowdown. Liquidity: Adequate LGOHL has adequate liquidity for funding the construction of its ongoing projects through a mix of customer advances, own funds and bank loans. The customer advances for its ongoing projects have been modest.  The cash flow from the ongoing projects is expected to sufficiently meet the term debt obligations. However, any unforeseen delay in project construction might result in cost overrun, thereby affecting debt repayment. Furthermore, any delay in receiving advances from customers is also expected to significantly impact the company’s liquidity. The company has moderate unsold inventory of previous projects of around Rs 61 crore and advance receivables will also aid the liquidity risk profile of the company. For the gold business, bank limit utilisation was around 90% for the 12 months ended March 2025. Outlook: Stable Crisil Ratings believes LGOHL will increase its scale of operations over the medium term supported by significant launch pipeline and healthy saleability in the ongoing projects, while maintaining a low leverage. It will also continue to benefit from the extensive industry experience of its promoters. Rating Sensitivity Factors Upward factors Early completion of ongoing projects and higher customer advances, resulting in substantial cash flow from operations Increase in bookings to over 50% with customer advances more than Rs 100 crore Downward factors Significant delay in cash inflow with collection from customers below 20% Higher-than-expected increase in debt, with slower-than-expected collections or delay in execution Low cash flow from operations (because of subdued response to, or delay in completion of, ongoing projects) weakening the financial risk profile and liquidity About the company Incorporated as Laxmi Goldorna House Pvt Ltd on January 7, 2010, in Gujarat, the company was converted into a public limited with the current name on July 25, 2017. The company is engaged in two business lines: gold trading and job work and real estate development. The company is currently constructing Laxmi 101 and Laxmi Courtyard in Ahmedabad. These projects comprise of 487 residential apartments and 73 shops. Mr Jayesh Chinubhai Shah and Ms Rupalben Jayeshkumar Shah are the promoters of LGOHL and manage the operations as well.

Details of Facilities/Instruments are in Annexure 1. Facility wise lender details are at

Detailed Rationale
As on 31 March 2025, CIFL has got fresh sanctions and there is also reduction in term loans
due to periodic repayments. Accordingly, the proposed and outstanding limits/instruments
have been reclassified at the request of the company.
The rating reaffirmation assigned to bank loan facilities and NCDs continues to derive comfort
from the comfortable capitalisation levels, sustained growth in AUM levels, diversified revenue
streams and experienced promoters and management. However, the rating strengths are
partially offset by average asset quality and inherent risks associated with MSME lending
coupled with intense competition.
Infomerics has assigned “Stable” outlook on the expectation of growth in overall financial
profile of the company in the near to medium term given the comfortable capitalisation and
established track record of the company.
1
Key Rating Sensitivities:
Upward Factors
• Substantial and sustained growth in scale of operations while maintaining comfortable
capitalisation, healthy asset quality, liquidity and profitability.
Downward Factors
• Substantial decline in scale of operations, capitalisation levels, profitability and asset
quality from the current levels.
List of Key Rating Drivers with Detailed Description
Key Rating Strengths
Comfortable capitalisation levels
CIFLs capitalisation remains comfortable with total Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets Ratio
(CRAR) of 36.63% as on 31 December 2024 (36.58% in FY24 (period refers from 01st April
2023 to 31st March 2024)) as against the minimum regulatory requirement of 15%. CIFL has
strong net worth of Rs 618.69 crore and low gearing of 1.03x as on 31 December 2024. The
capitalisation levels are expected to further improve on the back of the stake sale in its
subsidiary “Capital India Home Loans Ltd” (CIHL). CIFL holds 99.82% stake in CIHL and has
entered into “Share Purchase Agreement” on 16 October 2024 for selling its stake to “Weaver
Services Private Limited” for a consideration of Rs 267 crore. The said stake sale is subject to
Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) approval.
Sustained growth in MSME AUM
CIFLs MSME AUM has witnessed a sustained growth in last three years on the back of change
in business model. Prior to FY20, CIFL was majorly focusing on wholesale lending and given
the risks associated with wholesale/corporate lending, the company changed its business
model and forayed into “MSME” segment. Due to which, the proportion of wholesale/corporate
loans (Real estate, business loans and other loans to NBFCs/HFCs) reduced to 9% of total
AUM in 9MFY25 from 93% of total AUM in FY20. Given the rebalancing of portfolio towards
MSME segment, the AUM growth was stagnant in the last 3 years and currently stands at Rs
922.19 crore as on 31 December 2024 (Rs 913.04 crore in FY24).
Diversified revenue stream and strong earning profile
2
Capital India Finance Ltd (CIFL) is a non-deposit taking middle-layer non-banking financial
company (NBFC) registered with the Reserve Bank of India and holds AD-II license from RBI
for money changing business. CIFL has two revenue sources, income from lending activity
and income from forex services. During 9MFY25, Income from lending operations stood at
~87% and income from forex services stood at ~13%.
CIFLs earnings profile has consistently improved in the last three years with total income
increasing from Rs 122.76 crore in FY22 to Rs 194.66 crore in FY24. The increase is majorly
on account of sustainable increase of income from lending business and income from forex
services. Profitability of the company remains stable with Net Interest Margin (NIM) of 6.38%
for FY24 (6.29% in FY23). Infomerics expects that the earnings profile of the company to
improve substantially in the projected period given the strong capitalisation and further
expected capital inflows from stake sale in subsidiary.
Experienced promoters and management
Capital Group is promoted by Mr. Sumit K Narwar, a first-generation entrepreneur, who has
mentored and built businesses in Fintech and Financial services space. He currently serves
as the Chairman of Capital India Corp Private Limited (CICPL), which holds around 73% stake
in CIFL. CICPL is a core investment company registered with RBI and is the promoter entity
of Capital India Finance Limited (CIFL) an NBFC, Capital India Home Loans Ltd (CIHL), an
HFC and RapiPay Fintech Pvt Ltd (PPI license from RBI and Neo Bank). CIFL is led by Mr.
Keshav Porwal (Managing Director) and Mr. Pinank Shah (CEO), each having an experience
of more than two decades in financial services.
Key Rating Weaknesses
Average Asset quality
Given the strategic decision of the management to shift from wholesale lending to MSME
lending post 2020, the MSME loan book which was built in last 3-4 years constituting to ~82%
of AUM remains unseasoned. Hence, till FY23, GNPA levels were negligible and once the
portfolio started seasoning the GNPA levels increased in FY24 and then moderated in
9MFY25 coupled with fresh slippages from unsecured loan book (~15% of AUM), the asset
quality deteriorated with GNPA and NNPA increasing to 1.80% and 0.82% respectively in
3
FY24. However, the asset quality is expected to further moderate with seasoning of portfolio
as reflected in GNPA and NNPA numbers for 9MFY25 which stood at 1.86% and 0.93%
respectively.
Going forward, the ability of the company to improve and maintain healthy asset quality amidst
growing AUM levels will be a key rating monitorable.
Inherent risks associated with MSME lending coupled with intense competition
CIFL majorly caters to the MSME segment, which is highly vulnerable to downward economic
cycles given the low cash flow buffers. Further, the entire ~82% of AUM represents MSME
loans, with ~17% of loans falling under 1-90 buckets. The MSME industry is vulnerable to
lower economic growth, macro-economic conditions and operational risks, which could
adversely impact the company’s operations and thus its financial position. CIFL also faces
severe competition by other NBFCs and Banks.

Detailed Rationale
Infomerics Valuation and Rating Private Limited (IVR) has reaffirmed/assigned long term
rating to IVR BBB with revision in outlook to Positive from Stable outlook for the bank loan
facilities of RKEC Projects Limited (RPL).
The rating continues to draw comfort from the established track record of operations and
experienced management, demonstrated track record with proven project execution
capability, reputed clientele, healthy order book, improved debt protection metrics and
financial risk profile. However, these strengths are partially offset by tender based nature of
business, working capital intensive nature of operations and susceptibility of operating
margin to volatile input prices.
The ‘Positive’ outlook indicates improvement in scale of operations and profitability which
likely to sustain. IVR believes RPL’s will continue to benefit from its operational track record
in the business, its reputed clientele and inflow of orders as per the current order book
position.
IVR has principally relied on the standalone audited financial results of RPL upto 31 March
2024 (refers to period April 1st, 2023, to March 31, 2024), and projected financials for
FY2025, FY2026 and FY2027, and publicly available information/ clarifications provided by
the company’s management.
1
Key Rating Sensitivities:
Upward Factors
• Substantial improvement in the scale of operations with TOI above Rs. 500 crore
and EBITDA margins
• Improvement in debt protection metrics
• Sustenance of the overall gearing below.
Downward Factors
• Significant reduction in the scale of operations and profitability margins,
• Deterioration in debt protection metrics and overall gearing
• Low orders inflow or delay in execution of projects
List of Key Rating Drivers with Detailed Description
Key Rating Strengths
• Established track record of operations and experienced management:
The company commenced its operations in 2005 and has a successful track record of
around of more than 15 years in the existing line of business. Overall activities of RPL
are managed by Garapati Radhakrishna (Chairman cum Director) who has more than
three decades of experience in current line of business. He is ably supported by other
two directors namely Ms. Garapati Parvathi Devi and Garapati Ram Mohan. These
directors are ably supported by qualified and well experienced management team. Over
the years they have built strong relationships with customers and suppliers.
• Demonstrated track record with proven project execution capability:
RPL has long track record of more than a decade in EPC segment. Over the years of its
operation the company has gradually established its credentials and successfully
executed many projects. In order to manage the projects in a better way and to grow in a
balanced way, the company has a policy to take up short to medium term projects (18-36
months) and handle limited number of projects at a time to ensure timely completion.
The repeat orders received from its clientele validate its execution capabilities.
• Reputed clientele:
The company is dealing with government and private clients namely, Military Engineering
Services, Director General Navy Projects, Public Welfare Department, Adani Infra India
Limited, Vishakhapatnam Smart City Cooperation and various ports like Haldia Port
Trust, Visakhapatnam Port Trust, Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, Cochin Port Trust etc.
The company has been associated with most of the key clients for a long time, and the
successful execution of the projects has also helped it in getting repeat orders. Due to
reputed client profiles, the company has low counterparty credit risk although at times,
there can be delays in the realization of some bills.
2
• Healthy order book:
The company has a healthy unexecuted order book position to the tune of about Rs.
915.14 crore which is to be executed within 2-3 years, thereby providing a moderate
revenue visibility over medium term.
• Improved debt protection metrics and financial risk profile:
In terms of the debt coverage indicators, the interest service coverage ratio (ISCR) and
the debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) improved to at 3.24x and 2.24x respectively in
FY2024 from 2.96x and 1.79x respectively in FY2023. The tangible networth improved to
Rs. 168.43 crore in FY2024 from Rs. 148.10 crore in FY2023. The overall gearing stood
comfortable at 0.71x in FY2024. The total operating income (TOI) improved by ~13.71%
to Rs. 341.09 crore in FY2024 from Rs. 299.97 crore in FY2023.
Key Rating Weaknesses
• Working capital intensive nature of operations:
RPL’s operations are working capital intensive in nature, supported largely by bank
borrowings. The average utilisation of fund based and non-fund based working capital
limits of the company stood high around ~81.53% and ~78.31% respectively during the
last 12 months ending 31st May 2024.
• Tender based nature of business:
The company is mostly getting its orders through tenders floated by various government
departments. As the infrastructure industry is highly fragmented due to presence of many
organized and unorganized players tender driven nature of business leads to volatility in
revenue and profitability. Further, being in infrastructure segment the company is
exposed to inherent risks associated in this industry like slowdown in new order inflows,
risks of delays in execution etc.
• Susceptibility of operating margin to volatile input prices:
The company’s operating margins are susceptible to volatility in prices of raw materials,
although the same risk has been mitigated to some extent with the presence of price
escalation clause.
Analytical Approach: For arriving at the ratings, IVR has analysed RPL’s credit profile by
considering the standalone financial statements of the company.

Liquidity – Adequate
The company has an adequate liquidity position. There are long-term secured borrowings
from banks, amounting to Rs. 21.43 crore, as on 31 March 2024. Against a current portion of
long-term debt (CPLTD) of Rs 4.98 crore in FY2024, the company had a cash accrual of Rs.
29.26 crore in FY2024. The company projected to generate cash accruals of Rs. 34.20 crore
in FY2025 against a CPLTD of Rs. 11.29 crore. With the adequate expected cash accruals
against repayments, the liquidity position will remain adequate.

*Instrument details are provided in Annexure-I
Rationale
The ratings reaffirmation of Orbit Exports Limited’s (OEL) factors in the extensive experience of the promoters in the textile
industry and the company’s established position in the niche value-added fabrics and made-ups. The ratings also factor in the
strong financial profile of OEL, marked by low gearing and healthy debt coverage indicators, as well as a healthy liquidity
position.
The ratings, however, remain constrained by OEL’s moderate scale of operations as well as its working capital nature of
operations, as reflected by the net working capital vis-à-vis the operating income of 39% as on September 30, 2024, primarily
due to its high inventory holding period. However, ICRA notes that the working capital intensity is higher during H1 of any fiscal
year prior to the onset of the festive season. The company’s profitability also remains susceptible to the foreign exchange rate
fluctuation risks due to its export-dominated revenue profile, though hedging via forward contracts mitigates the risk to a large
extent. The company’s revenues and profitability are also exposed to global textile demand conditions and volatility in raw
material prices.
The Stable outlook on the [ICRA]A rating reflects ICRA’s opinion that OEL’s credit profile is expected to remain comfortable,
supported by its established presence in the niche value-added textiles segment and increasing focus on the domestic markets.
The financial profile will continue to remain strong with modest debt repayment obligations and sizeable cash and bank
balances, despite OEL’s capital expenditure plans.
Key rating drivers and their description
Credit strengths
Extensive experience of promoters in the textile industry – OEL was promoted as a private limited company in 1983 by Ms.
Shailaja Asave and Mr. Shyamsunder Seth for fabric manufacturing. In 1994, the company was converted into a public limited
concern. It is currently headed by Mr. Pankaj Seth and Ms. Anisha Seth, who acquired the company in 2004. The management
has an experience of more than two decades in manufacturing and around three decades in exporting fabrics, which enabled
the company to establish itself in the domestic as well as international markets.
Healthy profitability indicators, marked by high contribution from value-added products – OEL manufactures customised
textiles that find application in high fashion garments, home furnishings, bridal wear and various festive fabrics, which are
primarily high value-added products. This enables the company to charge a premium for its products. Further, a high
proportion of sales is derived from in-house fabric manufacturing. These, along with the management’s focus on high-margin
commodities have enabled the company to report a healthy OPM in the range of 25-30% during the last five years (except in
www.icra .in 1
Page |
FY2021 when the OPM moderated to 18% due to the adverse impact of the pandemic). Given the company’s continued focus
on the niche high value-added textiles segment, the OPMs are likely to sustain in the range of 26-27% in FY2025-FY2026.
Strong financial profile – OEL’s financial profile is strong, marked by a low gearing of 0.1 times as on March 31, 2024 due to a
healthy net worth position and limited reliance on debt. Its debt coverage indicators are robust, as reflected by an interest
cover of 18.5 times (compared to 16.3 times in FY2023) and total debt vis-à-vis the operating profit of 0.4 times in FY2024
(compared to 0.6 times in FY2023). Thus, the overall financial profile is comfortable. OEL’s dependence on debt has remained
negligible in the last two fiscals, driven by healthy cash flows and modest debt repayment obligations. Its liquidity position is
also strong with cash and liquid investments of Rs. 53 crore and unutilised fund-based limits of Rs. 24.5 crore as on September
30, 2024.
Credit challenges
Moderate scale of operations, demand headwinds in export markets – The scale of operations of the company is modest
with revenues of Rs. 201 crore in FY2024. While Indian apparel exports grew by 6% on a YoY basis during April-July 2024
following liquidation of inventory at the retailers’ level and benefits from China plus One strategy, challenges continue to
prevail amid inflationary pressure and tepid economic growth in key markets. This may exert some pressure on the company’s
exports in the current fiscal and constrain its modest, albeit improving, scale of operations. ICRA, however, draws comfort
from the established position of the company in the niche and high value-added segments and increasing presence of the
company’s products in the domestic market and steady demand from the US and the Middle East markets.
Working capital intensive nature of operations – The company’s working capital intensity of operations, as reflected by the
net working capital vis-à-vis the operating income, remained high at 39% as on September 30, 2024. This was primarily on
account of its high inventory holding period. As the company manufactures various fabrics as per customer specifications and
production is carried out in batches, it has a high finished inventory, resulting in increased working capital requirement. Also,
as OEL routes a portion of its sales through Group companies (based out of the US and the UAE), where the credit period
offered is higher, there is an elongation in the receivable cycle. However, ICRA notes that there are no delays in realisation of
receivables from the Group companies. Going forward, timely liquidation of inventory remains critical from the credit
perspective.
Vulnerability of profitability to global textile demand conditions, volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and raw
material prices; intense competition in the industry – OEL’s profitability remains susceptible to adverse movements in foreign
exchange rates as 60-70% of the revenues are derived from exports. However, the company has a hedging mechanism in place
against foreign exchange fluctuations, which provides comfort to a certain extent. OEL’s revenues and profitability also remain
susceptible to the cyclicality in the global textile industry and volatility in raw material prices. The textile industry is very
competitive due to the fragmented nature of the market and low entry barriers. OEL mostly faces competition from
international players. However, focus on a niche product segment has helped it partly mitigate the intense competition in the
industry and pass on the raw material price hikes to its customers, supporting its profitability.
Environmental and Social Risks
Environmental risks: The apparel industry is exposed to environmental risks, primarily through water, land use, impact of
climate on production and post-consumer waste. While these risks have not resulted in material implications so far, policy
actions towards waste management and the environmental impact such as to recycle the textile, could have cost implications
for the companies. These apart, dyeing and processing of fabrics cause water pollution and result in significant generation of
wastewater. OEL has implemented water treatment facilities at two of its manufacturing plants that enabled recycling of water,
resulting in a reduction in water wastage. Nonetheless, any disruption in measures taken for appropriate treatment of
wastewater/effluents could result in significant penalties, while also causing prolonged adverse impact to operations if the
authorities take any strict action.
www.icra .in 2
Page |
Social risks: Being a labour-intensive segment, the entities operating in the garment sector are exposed to the risk of disruption
due to inability to properly manage human capital in terms of their safety and the overall well-being. Measures taken by the
company towards employee welfare have, however, resulted in no adverse impact on the company’s performance from the
above-mentioned risks till date. Further, textile exporters are exposed to the risks of protests/conflicts with local communities.
Besides, shortage of skilled workers could also affect operations/growth plans and remains key concerns. Entities also remain
exposed to any major shift in consumer preferences or developments, affecting discretionary consumer spending in key
markets.
Liquidity position: Strong
OEL’s liquidity position is strong, supported by free cash/bank and liquid balances of Rs. 53 crore (including current investment
of Rs. 49.0 crore, comprising fixed deposits and mutual funds) and cushion available in the form of undrawn working capital
limits of Rs. 24.5 crore as on September 30, 2024. OEL’s average utilisation of working capital limits during the 18-month period
ended on November 30, 2024, stood at 15% (reflecting an average unutilised limit of Rs. 25.5 crore during the said period with
adequate drawing power). The company plans to incur partially debt-funded capex of ~Rs. 30 crore in FY2025. However, the
liquidity position will be supported by healthy net cash accruals and modest debt obligations of Rs. 7.93 crore in FY2025 and
Rs. 8.00 crore in FY2026. The company plans to incur maintenance capex of ~Rs. 10 crore in the medium term.
Rating sensitivities
Positive factors – The ratings may be upgraded if the company is able to register a significant growth in revenues while
maintaining its comfortable debt coverage metrics and liquidity position on a sustained basis.
Negative factors – The ratings may be downgraded if a significant decline in sales and profitability materially impacts the
company’s debt coverage indicators and liquidity position. Any larger-than-planned debt-funded capex, adversely impacting
the financial profile and liquidity position, would be a negative factor. Specific credit metric that could lead to ratings
downgrade includes weakening of return on capital employed to below 15% on a sustained basis.

The company did not proceed with the balance INR5,488.3 million as envisaged. # Overall ceiling of INR7,000 million under multiple banking arrangementsAnalytical ApproachInd-Ra continues to take a fully consolidated Sutlej’s subsidiary Sutlej Holdings, Inc (100% holding) and step-down subsidiary American Silk Mills LLC (100% holding) to arrive at the ratings because of the majority shareholding in these entities and related business profile.Detailed Rationale of the Rating ActionThe affirmation of the long-term ratings reflects Ind-Ra’s expectation that Sutlej will be able to maintain adequate liquidity over FY25-FY26, considering its reduced capex plans compared to the earlier greenfield capex, gradually recovering absolute EBITDA, and the availability of moderate unutilised fund-based limits and undrawn term loans. Sutlej had adequately managed liquidity in FY24 by liquidating substantial inventory for releasing working capital, despite EBITDA losses. The affirmation is additionally supported by a directional improvement in the sales and EBITDA from 4QFY24. Ind-Ra also factors into the rating the management calling off a large debt-led greenfield capex plan of INR9,410 million which could have otherwise impacted the cash flows. The downgrade of the short-term debt rating and Negative Outlook reflect Sutlej’s deteriorated operational performance in FY24, leading to EBITDA losses and thus a negative net adjusted leverage ratio. Ind-Ra expects the net adjusted leverage to exceed 4.5x over FY25 before improving FY26 onwards. List of Key Rating DriversStrengths• Stable cash flows despite incurring EBITDA losses; likely to remain positive in FY25-FY26•   Greenfield expansion project called off• EBITDA margins turn positive from 4QFY24; likely to recover• Despite subdued export demand, home textiles division to become profitable from FY25• Strong business profile Weaknesses• Deteriorated credit metrices in FY24; likely to improve gradually • Forex risks• Inherent industry risks Detailed Description of Key Rating DriversStable Cash Flows Despite Incurring EBITDA Losses; Likely to Remain Positive in FY25-FY26: Sutlej maintained stable cash flows despite negative EBITDA in FY24, due to increased efforts towards working capital release. The cash flow from operations was INR1,755 million in FY24 (FY23: INR1,555 million; FY22: INR1,628 million). Ind-Ra expects the cash flow to remain positive in FY25-FY26, factoring in lower working capital requirements and a gradual improvement in EBITDA. Sutlej had maintained high levels of inventory in FY23, driven by high demand expectations. However, the company decided to liquidate the excess inventory in FY24 at losses, due to a subdued industry demand. The inventory reduced to INR5,178 million in FY24 (FY23: INR7,566 million; FY22: INR6,094 million). The free cash flows stood at INR1,034 million in FY24 (FY23: negative INR172 million; FY22: INR725 million). Greenfield Expansion Project Called Off: Sutlej has called off its greenfield capex plan of INR9,410 million for setting up 89,184 spindles comprising cotton mélange yarn and poly/cotton (polyester >50%) grey yarn, along with a dye house in Jammu & Kashmir, due to the subdued demand. However, the company would incur capex of around INR3,400 million towards the modernisation, technology upgradation and de-bottlenecking of the existing facilities to further improve its plant efficiency over FY25-FY28, of which around INR2,500 million would be funded through an external debt (INR1,400 million tied-up) and the balance would be funded through internal accruals.  EBITDA Margins Turn Positive from 4QFY24; Likely to Recover: Ind-Ra expects EBITDA margins to recover over 6% during FY25-FY26, considering the domestic and exports demand picking up and excess inventory losses already being booked. The EBITDA margins turned positive to 0.7% in 4QFY24 (3QFY24: negative 0.9%; 2QFY24: negative 4.7%; 1QFY24: negative 0.2%) on recovering spreads post inventory losses booked over 9MFY24. On an annual basis, the EBITDA margins deteriorated to negative 1.1% in FY24 (FY23; 8.7%; FY22: 12.6%), due to volatility in raw material prices leading to inventory losses and lower export demand which had impacted industry players across the sector. The EBITDA stood at negative INR293 million in FY24 (FY23: INR2,679 million; FY22: INR3,874 million). The yarn division contributed around 92% to the total revenue in FY24, which Ind-Ra expects to remain in the same range over FY25-FY26.  Despite Subdued Export Demand, Home Textiles Division to Become Profitable from FY25: In FY24, despite the subdued export demand, the losses from the home textiles division reduced year-on-year and the realisations increased to INR549/metre (FY23: INR425/metre). The management expects the division to generate positive EBITDA from FY25, in view of a higher export demand basis the order book for the next 30-60 days, leading to increased capacity utilisation and thus increased volumes. The home textile division contributed around 8% to the total revenue in FY24 which the agency expects to remain in the same range over FY25-FY26.  Strong Business Profile: Sutlej holds a leading position in India’s value-added spun-dyed yarn industry, which has limited players in the dyed and mélange yarn segment in the organised sector. The company has over nine decades of operational track record, leading to established relationships with its customers and suppliers. This ensures uninterrupted product availability from key suppliers and repeat orders from reputed customers including some of the large brands worldwide. The ratings are also supported by Sutlej’s geographical diversification across the domestic and export markets, product diversification across value-added yarns, four plant locations and recently commissioned Sutlej Green Fibre plant. Exports accounted for 39% of the company’s revenue in FY24 (FY23: 41%; FY22: 42%). Also, Sutlej has a diversified customer base with its top 10 customers accounting for around 18% of the total revenue in FY24 (FY23: 20%; FY22: 19%), reflecting a low concentration risk.  Deteriorated Credit Metrices in FY24; Likely to Improve Gradually: Sutlej’s interest coverage (EBITDA/gross interest expense) reduced to negative 0.45x in FY24 (FY23: 4.63x; FY22: 7.78x) and the net adjusted leverage (net debt/EBITDA) turned negative 28.80x (3.52x; 2.40x). The agency expects the EBITDA margins to recover gradually, leading to the net adjusted leverage to exceed 4.5x in FY25 and gradually taper down from FY26. Forex Risks: Sutlej’s exports comprised around 39% of the total revenue in FY24 while the import of raw materials was minimal. Thus, being a net exporter, Sutlej's margins are exposed to forex risk. However, as a practice, the company fully hedges its forex exposure to reduce the risk. Ind-Ra believes Sutlej will remain exposed to forex risks, but efficient hedging practices are likely to aid in minimising the losses. In FY24, Sutlej registered a forex gain of INR14.8 million (FY23: loss of INR131.5 million; FY22: gain of INR84.7 million). Inherent Industry Risks: The Indian textile industry is highly fragmented due to the low-entry barriers, particularly in the yarn segment. Moreover, Sutlej faces fluctuating operating margins due to volatile raw material prices. The raw material cost as a percentage of revenue was about 63% for FY24 (FY23: 54%; FY22: 52%). The supplier concentration on polyester staple fibre and viscose, the key raw materials, is high, leading to low bargaining power with such raw material suppliers. Moreover, the company faces high price elasticity of demand as the key end-industry (fabrics) is based on consumer discretion. Furthermore, the domestic textile industry is characterised by intense competition from the unorganised segment, which poses risk to the margins and supply chain. However, Sutlej with diversified exposure to cotton and blended yarn is less affected than pure cotton yarn spinners as synthetic fibre prices are less volatile than raw cotton prices. LiquidityAdequate: Sutlej’s average utilisation of the sanctioned fund-based limits excluding bill discounting facilities was around 75% for the 12 months ended June 2024, providing sufficient liquidity cushion despite the low free cash balances (FYE24: INR29 million; FYE23: INR107 million; FYE22: INR118 million). The company’s gross working capital cycle reduced to 157 days in FY24 (FY23: 205 days; FY22: 191 days), on account of a decrease in the inventory holding period to 111 days (167 days; 139 days), despite increased receivable days of 46 (39; 52). The management states that the inventory days would remain at 120-125 days with no excess inventory maintenance plans. Ind-Ra expects Sutlej’s liquidity to remain adequate in FY25-FY26, considering the unutilised portion of the fund-based limit of around INR1,171 million as of March 2024, and unavailed debt from banks of around INR1,400 million for the modernisation project. Sutlej’s scheduled debt repayments for FY25 and FY26 stand at INR960 million and INR1,060 million, respectively.Rating SensitivitiesPositive: An improvement in the profitability and working capital leading to visibility of the net adjusted leverage reducing below 2.75x while maintaining adequate liquidity, all on a sustained basis, would lead to the Outlook being revised to Stable. Negative: Lower-than expected EBITDA or an additional significant unexpected debt-funded capex, and/or higher-than-expected working capital, leading to the net adjusted leverage remaining above 2.75x, and/or a weakening of the liquidity, would lead to a negative rating action.Any Other InformationStandalone Performance: Sutlej reported revenue of INR26,717 million in FY24 (FY23: INR30,392 million; FY22: INR30,420 million) and EBITDA of negative INR214 million (INR2,725 million; INR3,874 million) with EBITDA margins of negative 0.80% (8.97%; 12.73%). The interest coverage reduced to negative 0.34x in FY24 (FY23: 4.81x; FY22: 7.95x) and the net leverage turned negative 38.37x (3.41x; 2.41x). About the CompanySutlej manufactures synthetic, natural, and blended yarns and home furnishing textiles such as curtains and made ups. It is a part of the multi-product conglomerate KK Birla Group. Sutlej has an annual spinning capacity of 426,528 spindles and a home textile capacity of 8.4 million metres.

Detailed Rationale of the Rating Action The upgrade reflects an increase in the linkages of RRIL with SVG, the successful turnaround of the company’s operations after the takeover by SVG and continued strong credit metrics in FY24. However, the ratings are constrained by volatile input costs. List of Key Rating Drivers Strengths Linkages with strong parentSuccessful turnaround of RRIL's operations; incremental capex to boost revenue in near termContinued strong credit metrics; likely to improve further in medium termWeaknessesVolatility in input costs Detailed Description of Key Rating Drivers Linkages with Strong Parent: SVG had acquired an 85% stake in RRIL in October 2021 for INR549 million, with 10% being held by the directors of SVG and the rest by the public. The parent has provided a post-default corporate guarantee for INR4,620 million of RRIL’s debt. As per FY24 provisional financials, SVG’s turnover declined to INR2,747 million (FY23: INR3,014 million) and operational profit at INR622 million (INR598 million) with an interest coverage of 31.36x (46.68x). SVG maintained a net cash position and had cash and cash equivalents of INR997 million at FYE24 (FYE23: INR853 million). Ind-Ra expects RRIL’s legal and strategic linkages with SVG to remain strong. Also, SVG, as part of its backward integration strategy, utilises yarn produced by RRIL which constituted around 17% of its total purchases in FY24 (FY23:5%). RRIL benefits from SVG’s experienced management, who has an established presence in the textile market since 1994. Furthermore, RRIL has availed inter corporate loans from SVG with an outstanding balance of INR481.87 as of March 2024, providing financial flexibility to the company. While there have been no repayment terms specified, a nominal interest charge has been made on the same. Successful Turnaround of RRIL's Operations; Incremental Capex to Boost Revenue in Near Term: Although RRIL was established in 1984, the company was under the National Company Law Tribunal and stopped production from July 2018.  RRIL resumed operations in January 2023 and achieved revenue of INR7,450 million in FY24 (FY23: INR1,372 million), as FY24 was the first full year of operations after the takeover by SVG and the successful completion of its first phase of capex towards the refurbishment and capacity expansion in partially oriented yarn (POY) and polyester yarn (PTY) plants as well as its increased capacity utilisation of the same. RRIL had sanctioned term loans of INR1,850 million for the refurbishment and expansion of its plant and machinery as of March 2023, out of which INR1,350 million was disbursed as of March 2024 and the remaining would be drawn during FY25 for the second phase of the capex.  The company is undertaking the second phase of the capex towards capacity addition in POY and PTY plants with a total budget of INR1,800 million, of which INR1,335 million would be funded through sanctioned term loans from banks, and the remaining through its parent support. Ind Ra expects RRIL's revenue to increase in the near term backed by the successful completion of the second phase of the capex in FY25 and increased capacity utilisation. Continued Strong Credit Metrics; likely to Improve Further in Medium Term: On a consolidated basis, RRIL’s credit metrics remained strong given SVG’s net cash position in FY24. The consolidated net leverage (net debt/EBITDA) remained low at 0.26x in FY24 (FY23: 0.32x) and Ind-Ra expects the same to peak to 1.16x in FY25, due to the company’s capex plan and to reduce in FY26 with an improvement in the company’s performance. The gross interest coverage (operating EBITDA/gross interest expense) is also likely to remain comfortable above 4x during FY25-FY26. On a standalone basis, RRIL posted low EBITDA margin of 3.6% in FY24 (4QFY23: 1.2%). However, the management expects RRIL's standalone EBITDA margins to improve in the medium term on account of the advantage of economies of scale. This, coupled with consistent EBITDA margins achieved by SVG is likely to boost the consolidated EBITDA margins by 2%-3% in the medium term. Volatility in Input Costs: RRIL's raw materials primarily constitute purified terephthalic acid and mono ethylene glycol which are crude oil derivatives. Hence, EBITDA margins are often susceptible to volatile nature of the input costs. Although RRIL is not able to pass on the volatility in input costs entirely to its customers, it has been working towards a reduction in other operational costs by achieving economies of scale. Liquidity Adequate: On a consolidated basis, the group had cash and cash equivalents of INR1,138 million at FYE24 (FYE23: INR944 million). RRIL’s average month-end utilisation of the fund-based limits was 27.73% during the 12 months ended July 2024, while that of the non-fund-based limits was 40% during the 12 months ended August 2024. RRIL’s cash flow from operations turned positive during FY24 at INR695 million (FY23: negative INR765 million) on account of favourable working capital changes during the year. RRIL has scheduled repayments of INR203.5 million and INR284.68 million in FY25 and FY26, respectively. RRIL’s cash and cash equivalents stood at INR70 million at FYE24 (FYE23: INR2 million). On a consolidated basis, the group has repayments of INR231.08 million in FY25 and INR297.23 million in FY26. Given the strong cash flows estimated to be generated by the group, the repayments can be met by internal accruals comfortably. Rating Sensitivities Positive: A substantial improvement in the scale of operations, on a standalone and consolidated basis, and an improvement in the standalone profitability and the consolidated net leverage remaining below 2x while maintaining the adequate liquidity would be positive for the ratings. Negative: Substantial deterioration on the scale of operations or profitability on a consolidated basis or substantial deterioration in liquidity or the net leverage remaining above 3x or a weakening of the linkages with the parent would be negative for the ratings. Any Other Information Standalone Profile: RRIL's revenue grew to INR7,450 million during FY24 (FY23: INR1,372 million) and EBITDA margins stood at 3.66% (1.29%). The interest coverage (operating EBITDA/gross interest expenses) improved to 2.44x in FY24 (FY23: 1.37x), due to the improvement in absolute EBIDTA to INR272 million (INR17 million), while the net leverage (total adjusted net debt/operating EBITDAR) reduced to 6.21x (71.14x) owing to the improvement in the EBITDA.

Rationale
ICRA has kept the BLR rating and Non-Convertible Debenture of Consolidated Construction Consortium Limited in the ‘Issuer
Not Cooperating’ category. The rating is denoted as [ICRA]D; ISSUER NOT COOPERATING/[ICRA]D; ISSUER NOT COOPERATING.”
As part of its process and in accordance with its rating agreement with Consolidated Construction Consortium Limited, ICRA
has been trying to seek information from the entity so as to monitor its performance. Further, ICRA has been sending repeated
reminders to the entity for payment of surveillance fee that became due. Despite multiple requests by ICRA, the entity’s
management has remained non-cooperative. In the absence of requisite information and in line with the aforesaid policy of
ICRA, the rating has been continued to the “Issuer Not Cooperating” category. The rating is based on the best available
information.

Rating Rationale Rating Rationale May 22, 2024 | Mumbai GRP LimitedRatings upgraded to 'CRISIL A-/Stable/CRISIL A2+' Rating ActionTotal Bank Loan Facilities RatedRs.135.46 CroreLong Term RatingCRISIL A-/Stable (Upgraded from 'CRISIL BBB+/Stable')Short Term RatingCRISIL A2+ (Upgraded from 'CRISIL A2')Note: None of the Directors on CRISIL Ratings Limited’s Board are members of rating committee and thus do not participate in discussion or assignment of any ratings. The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities Detailed Rationale CRISIL Ratings has upgraded its ratings on the bank facilities of GRP Ltd (GRP) to ‘CRISIL A-/Stable/CRISIL A2+’ from ‘CRISIL BBB+/Stable/CRISIL A2’. The upgrade reflects an expected healthy improvement in the business risk profile of GRP while sustaining a comfortable financial risk profile through fiscal 2025. Revenue increased by 2% (on-year) to ~Rs 462 crore in fiscal 2024, supported by ~7% growth in volumes and partial realisation from sale of extended producer responsibility (EPR) credits to tire companies while realisations moderated. EPR norms set by the Central Pollution Control Board, part of the Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change, requires tire companies to offset their producer obligation through purchase of EPR credits from recyclers who use domestic end-of-life waste tires. Revenue may rise by 16-20% in fiscal 2025, supported by volume growth of 15-20% owing to healthy demand scenario supported by enhanced capacities through debottlenecking activities in the reclaim rubber segment and higher sales of EPR credits to tire companies. Operating efficiency has also improved, with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation margin of ~10.8% in fiscal 2024, as compared to 6.6% in fiscal 2023, supported by various cost efficiency programs undertaken by the company and sales of EPR credits, which directly flows to profits. The company has been able to reduce their energy costs per tonne of end product through lower power cost with total wind power capacities of 3.75 megawatt and further improved margin through reducing employee expenses. The operating margin may further improve to 13-15% in fiscal 2025, driven by better fixed costs absorption, savings in energy and fuel costs as well as incremental income from sale of EPR credits. The company has invested in biofuel plants that are operational from May 2024 and expected to result in yearly cost savings of Rs 7 crore fiscal 2025 onwards. The financial risk profile is likely to remain adequate, with gearing below 0.75 time over the medium term, despite annual capital expenditure (capex) of Rs 50-60 crore to set up a facility to manufacture rubber crumbs and downstream products. The ratings continue to reflect the established market position of GRP in the reclaimed rubber industry, beneficiary of the EPR norms for tire manufactures and importers and adequate financial risk profile. These strengths are partially offset by susceptibility to fluctuations in raw material prices and exposure to tire industry concentration in revenue. Analytical Approach CRISIL Ratings has combined the business and financial risk profiles of GRP and its subsidiaries, Gripsurya Recycling LLP and GRP Circular Solutions Ltd. This is because all the entities, together referred to as the GRP group, are in the same business and have operational synergies. Please refer Annexure - List of Entities Consolidated, which captures the list of entities considered and their analytical treatment of consolidation. Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description Strengths: Established market position in the reclaimed rubber industry: GRP is one of the top three manufacturers of reclaimed rubber globally and the largest in India. The company has built healthy relationships with domestic and international tire manufacturers and distributors. Exports to the US, Europe and Latin America contributed 58% of total revenue in fiscal 2024. Domestic customers include several large and prominent original equipment manufacturers. Increase in composition of reclaimed rubber in tires manufactured by global players should augur well for GRP. Allied businesses such as engineering plastics (EP), polymer composites (PC) and custom die forms (CDF) have contributed to 11% of total revenue in fiscal 2024. Ramp-up in PC and EP capacities on the back of healthy demand and the recent capex should support further diversification in the revenue profile. Beneficiary of inclusion of tire manufacturers and importers under the EPR norms: The company is set to benefit from the regulations that include tire manufacturers in the EPR framework of the government. Since the mechanism for sale of credit has been put in place in fiscal 2024, GRP has sold part of its credits generated for fiscal 2023, in fiscal 2024. The remainder of credits for fiscal 2023 along with credits generated for its recycling activities in fiscal 2024 will be realised in fiscal 2025. The mechanism for awarding and consequential selling of the same is still in the initial stages where the formulae may undergo a change as deemed necessary by the regulatory authorities. Overall, the company is expected to realize incremental benefits over that of fiscal 2024 subject to the EPR policy changes from time to time. Adequate financial risk profile: The financial risk profile has been adequate and will continue to improve. Networth stood at Rs 167 crore in fiscal 2024, increasing from Rs 147 crore in fiscal 2023, with steady accretion to reserve. Debt for fiscal 2024 stood at Rs 113 crore, of which a majority is short-term working capital debt. Yet, debt protection metrics remain comfortable, with interest coverage ratio of over 7 times for fiscal 2024 and gearing of 0.67 time as on March 31, 2024. The company is planning a rights issue of Rs 40 crore to fund its capex in fiscal 2025; this will further strengthen the financial risk profile. Weaknesses: Susceptibility to fluctuations in raw material prices: Raw material cost accounts for around half of the operating income. End-of-life rubber tire, the input, is procured from an extensive chain of suppliers. Changes in raw material prices could impact operating margin, which has fluctuated between 5% and 9% over the five fiscals through March 2024. High concentration of revenue from the tire industry: GRP is highly dependent on the performance of the tire industry, which accounts for 65-70% of its revenue. While the company has diversified into multiple segments such as EP, PC and CDF, the extent of revenue contribution from these remains critical. Liquidity: Adequate Net cash accrual stood at Rs 35 crore in fiscal 2024, against debt obligation of Rs 5-7 crore. Net cash accrual is projected at Rs 50-70 crore per fiscal, sufficient to meet yearly debt repayment of Rs 5-10 crore and annual capex requirement of Rs 50-60 crore. Bank limit utilisation was around 74% for fiscal 2024. Liquidity stood at Rs 2 crore as on March 31, 2024 further supported by sanctioned working capital limits of Rs. 92 crores. Outlook: Stable GRP will sustain its operating performance with steady revenue growth, further supported by income from sale of EPR credits over the medium term. Financial risk profile will continue to improve, driven by strong gearing and debt protection metrics. Rating Sensitivity factors Upward factors Sustained double-digit revenue growth backed by increase in volume while maintaining operating profitability, leading to net cash accrual more than Rs 75 crore Improvement in the financial risk profile Downward factors Sustained decline in revenue and operating profitability dropping below 8% Increase in working capital debt or large, debt-funded capex About the Company Established by Mr Rajendra V Gandhi in 1974, GRP manufactures reclaimed rubber (recycled rubber) from end-of-life tires and tubes. Having commenced operations as a tire recycling company, GRP has transformed into a sustainable materials company over the years. It also separates nylon from tires to produce raw material for sale to engineering plastic component manufacturers for automotive and electrical applications. The residue rubber from the above businesses is used by yet another business to blend with recycled plastic waste and produce composite material, which replaces wood and concrete. The company is a leader in the domestic tire recycling industry, and among the top five manufacturers globally. GRP has total installed capacity of 84,200 tonne per annum across all business segments.

Rationale and key rating drivers
Ratings assigned to bank facilities of Mayur Uniquoters Limited (MUL) continue to derive strength from over four decades of
experience of its promoter in the artificial leather industry, MUL’s strong market position in the organised segment of polyvinyl
chloride (PVC) coated fabric, wide product portfolio with diverse industry applications, established and reputed clientele and
product approvals from leading domestic and global automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) with strong entry
barriers. Ratings also factor MUL’s presence in OEM and automotive replacement market, the footwear and furnishing
segments, and its focus on high-margin products in domestic and export markets, supported by its product development
capabilities and backward integration, enabling the company to generate healthy profitability margins. Ratings further continue
to consider MUL’s financial risk profile marked by comfortable leverage, and strong debt coverage indicators on account of low
debt levels and healthy cash flow generation and its strong liquidity. CARE Ratings Limited (CARE Ratings) also takes
cognisance of the growth in sales volume in FY24 (refers to April 01 to March 31) and H1FY25 year-over-year (y-o-y) and the
expectation of further growth in FY25-FY27, supported by an increase in demand from auto OEMs and ramp-up of poly
urethane (PU) operations.
However, rating strengths are tempered by MUL’s exposure to raw material price volatility and foreign currency fluctuation risk,
continued elongated working capital cycle, and presence in highly fragmented and competitive artificial leather industry,
especially in the lower value-added segment of the market. Ratings also take cognisance of continued under-utilisation of PU
coated fabric capacity due to delay in the ramp-up of operations which restricts its profitability and return ratios to an extent.
Rating sensitivities: Factors likely to lead to rating actions
Positive factors
• Significant increase in its total operating income (TOI) to beyond ₹1,200 crore through greater geographical and product
diversification, while maintaining its return on capital employed (ROCE) of 25% from core operations, healthy profit before
interest, lease rentals, depreciation and taxation (PBILDT) margin and comfortable leverage and debt coverage indicators.
• Contraction in its gross working capital cycle to less than 90 days on a sustained basis.
Negative factors
• Decline in the PBILDT margin below 18% on a sustained basis and moderation in its debt coverage indicators.
• Deterioration in the overall gearing beyond 0.50x on a gross debt basis.
• Negative cash flow from operations on a sustained basis.
Analytical approach: Consolidated
CARE Ratings has considered MUL’s consolidated financials including its subsidiaries, as its subsidiaries are primarily set-up for
undertaking marketing and distribution of MUL’s products in different foreign geographies. Being MUL’s marketing arm, there is
also cash flow fungibility with its subsidiaries. The list of subsidiaries whose financials have been consolidated in MUL is
mentioned in Annexure-6.
Outlook: Stable
Stable outlook reflects that MUL is likely to maintain its market position which coupled with strong and reputed clientele across
a diverse end-user industry and strong entry barriers should enable it to sustain its financial risk profile over the medium term.

Press Release
Detailed description of key rating drivers:
Key strengths
Vast experience of promoters in the artificial/synthetic leather industry
Suresh Kumar Poddar, Chairman, Managing Director, and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of MUL, has over four decades of
experience in trading and manufacturing artificial leather. He manages the company’s overall operations, including production,
marketing, and strategy and has been directly associated with the successful implementation of inventory management and
other cost-reduction techniques like total quality management (TQM), total productive maintenance (TPM), and research and
development (R&D) initiatives in the company. Moreover, Arun Kumar Bhagaria, Executive Director, has a similar experience of
over a decade and is actively involved in managing the business. Manav Poddar, the son of Suresh Poddar, was expected to join
MUL’s board. However, he does not hold a board position at present but is involved in the business operations.
Leader in the organised segment of the domestic artificial/synthetic leather industry
MUL has the largest installed capacity for manufacturing synthetic leather in the domestic organised segment with a capacity of
486 lakh linear metres per annum (LLMPA) of PVC-coated fabric and 50 LLMPA of PU coated. MUL manufactures over 400
variants of artificial leather from PVC polymer, which finds application in footwear (shoes and sandals in-sole and uppers),
automotive (seat upholstery, door trims, steering wheel covers, and inner linings among others), furnishing (sofa, chair, and
cushion cover among others), and fashion items (apparel, bag and belts among others).
Strong and reputed clientele across diverse end-user industries with strong entry barriers
MUL has a strong and diversified clientele across industries and caters the synthetic leather requirements of reputed players like
Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, MG Motors, Kia Motors, Volkswagen India, Hyundai, Honda Motorcycles,
Bata, Relaxo, VKC, Paragon, and Baggit among others and shares long-standing relationships with most clientele. Generally,
MUL sells its products to approved vendors of the OEMs, which in turn, supply the products to OEMs. Owing to consistency in
its product quality, stringent quality-control measures and adherence to delivery schedule, MUL is one of the few approved
vendors in Asia by global automotive OEMs, including Ford (the US), Chrysler (the US), Mercedes Benz (South Africa) and BMW.
In FY24, MUL derived 31% of its consolidated revenue from exports (FY23: 29%) mainly from the US which is expected to
increase as the supply to Mercedes and BMW contributes meaningfully to its sales.
Getting product approval from major global automobile OEMs is a time-consuming and costly process, which takes around two
to three years before supplies start. Hence, the entry barrier is high in such business, as switching and changing of suppliers by
OEMs until the discontinuation of a car model is rare once the product is approved.
In-house product development, adequate backward integration, and focus on high-margin products
Over the years, MUL has generated healthy operating profit margins in an otherwise fragmented and unorganised synthetic
leather industry considering its focus on in-house product development and innovation, adequate backward integration, and
focus on high-margin products (in the domestic and export markets). MUL has sufficient capacity to produce knitted fabrics
used in automotive exports, which apart from other value-added processes (printing, embossing, lamination), results in cost
efficiency, better quality control, and consistency in supply, which increases customer stickiness.
The production of artificial leather grew in the last couple of years supported by a recovery in demand from the footwear and
the automotive industries. Capacity utilisation has been improving over the years and is further expected to improve in the
medium term with the addition of new clients and/or models and an improvement in demand from the end-user industries. With
the improvement in capacity utilisation, moderation in raw material prices and a better product mix, CARE Ratings expects the
company’s operating profitability (PBILDT) margin to remain healthy over 22% in the medium term.
Continued growth in the scale of operations with healthy profitability in FY24 and H1FY25
MUL’s TOI on a consolidated level has grown at compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6% in the last five years ended FY24
and grew by 3% in FY24 over FY23. Growth in sales in FY24 were supported by increase in sales volume which was partially
off-set by decline in average sales realisation followed by decline in raw material cost. Growth in sales volume, favourable
product mix and cost control led to improvement in PBILDT margin by 181 bps to 20.45% in FY24 (FY23: 18.64%). Profit after
tax (PAT) also rose to ₹122 crore in FY24 from ₹101 crore reported in FY23. With improved scale of operations and profitability
margin, the company’s gross cash accruals (GCA) also grew to ₹151 crore in FY24 (FY23: ₹124 crore).
Despite healthy profitability, the company’s ROCE remained at 19% in FY24, as MUL’s liquid investment portfolio constituted 25-
30% of its total capital employed, which generated low returns, and thus impacted the company’s overall return indicators.
In H1FY25, MUL’s TOI on a consolidated level, grew by 6% on a y-o-y basis with an improvement in PBILDT margin by 283 bps
to 26.22% (H1FY24: 23.39%). With increase in share of margin lucrative automotive export, revenue is expected to grow with
improvement in profitability margin. Moreover, retailing of PVC fabric is also expected to support growth in coming years. MUL
entered the retail furnishing business (~40% of synthetic leather market) under brand name “Texture and Hues” through its
2 CARE Ratings Ltd.
Press Release
wholly owned subsidiary, ‘Mayur TecFab Private Limited’. The company has plan to build dealership network of 1,000 dealers of
which the company has already over 700 dealers as on November 2024.
Strong financial risk profile
The company’s capital structure on a consolidated level continued to remain comfortable, marked by an overall gearing ratio of
0.05x as on March 31, 2024, backed by its healthy capital base of ₹867 crore as on date. The company’s capital structure is
expected to remain comfortable due to its relatively low reliance on debt, on the back of healthy cash flow generation and
absence of major debt-funded capex. Moreover, debt coverage indicators marked by PBILDT interest coverage and total debt to
GCA continued to remain strong in FY24, backed by low debt levels and healthy profitability. Debt coverage indicators are
expected to remain strong due to healthy profitability and cash accruals.
Liquidity: Strong
Despite an elongated operating cycle, MUL’s liquidity remains strong with a current ratio of 8.14x as on March 31, 2024, and
negligible utilisation of fund-based working capital limits for the trailing 12 months ended September 2024. Further, MUL had
unencumbered liquid investments and a cash and bank balance aggregating to ₹287 crore as on March 31, 2024, significantly
exceeding the company’s total debt, resulting in a zero net debt position for the company. MUL’s liquidity is expected to remain
strong, backed by the strong generation of cash flow from operations and relatively lower capex. Post buyback of equity shares
worth ₹50 crore (including tax) in H1FY25, unencumbered liquid investments continued to remain high at ~₹223 crore as on
September 30, 2024.
Key weaknesses
Continued elongated working capital cycle restricted operating cash flow
MUL’s operations remain working capital intensive marked by operating cycle of 158 days in FY24 due to continued high
inventory holding. The company maintains around three months of raw material inventory for smooth production due to the
lead time involved in the import of some raw materials. Moreover, export sales entail a lead time of around two months and one
month of finished goods inventory in overseas market, which also leads to a higher requirement for inventory. Furthermore, the
company extends a credit period of ~30-90 days to its customers. With increase in automotive exports, the operating cycle is
expected to remain elongated in the near-to-medium term. As informed by the management, manufacturing plant near client
location can reduce working capital requirement. The company is contemplating capacity expansion of PVC fabric through
greenfield project in Mexico to cater its existing and prospective clients in USA. However, the company is yet to finalise on the
decision of its plant set up and is evaluating the impact of recently concluded USA elections. Management also informed that
project implementation is expected to take two years once it starts.
Increasing working capital requirement has adversely impacted its operating cash flow, which remained at ~₹369 crore
(cumulative for the last five years ended FY24), against a cumulative PBIDLT of ₹684 crore and a cumulative GCA of ₹593 crore
over this period. However, despite the restricted cash flow from operations, MUL’s reliance on external debt has remained low
as the majority incremental working capital requirements are being funded by internal accruals.
Exposure to raw material price volatility and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
~80% MUL’s raw materials are derivatives of crude oil, hence, the prices of its raw materials vary with fluctuations in
international crude oil prices. MUL enters medium-term contracts with its suppliers to mitigate large raw material price volatility.
Moreover, MUL being a market leader has the bargaining power to pass on the increase in raw material prices to its customers,
resulting in a relatively steady gross margin of ~40% in the last five years ended FY24. MUL is also exposed to foreign
exchange rate fluctuations, considering its large imports, which was 48% of its total raw material requirement in FY24.
However, the forex risk is majorly mitigated through the natural hedge available through exports.
Under-utilisation of the newly commissioned greenfield PU-coated fabric project restricted profitability and
return ratio
MUL has forayed in manufacturing PU-coated fabric by setting up one coating line (consisting of one wet and one dry line)
under Phase-I with a capacity to produce 50 LLMPA of PU fabric. The company has constructed a building and other peripheral
infrastructure for four coating lines, considering the future expansion plans. As compared to PVC-coated fabric, PU-coated fabric
has a closer resemblance to natural leather, with better realisations of the product. PU-coated fabric finds applications across
similar industries such as footwear, fashion accessories, furnishing, and automotive upholstery. At present, over 90% of the PU-
coated fabric is being imported from China, with the presence of a few domestic manufacturers with limited capacity. MUL
foresees this as a cross-selling opportunity to its existing PVC fabric customers. Despite imposition of an anti-dumping duty
(ADD) by the central government, the capacity utilisation from PU continues to remain below 25% in FY24. MUL is planning to
tie up with some of the global footwear players to increase capacity utilisation with long-term revenue visibility. With gradual
approval from customers, revenue from the PU business is expected to gradually reach ₹100 crore in the medium term. Due to
3 CARE Ratings Ltd.
Press Release
the envisaged gradual ramp-up of its operations and competition from Chinese imports in its PU segment, its blended PBILDT
margin could be impacted in the near-term. Thereby, the early stabilisation and ramp-up of the PU project remain critical for
aiding the growth and profitability of the company, and in turn, improvement in its return indicators. Furthermore, as informed
by the management, MUL may also plan a second phase of the project after stabilisation of the first phase.

*Instrument details are provided in Annexure-I; ^ including proposed limits of Rs. 30 crore (PY: Rs. 95 crore)
Rationale
The ratings reaffirmation of Sahyadri Industries Limited (SIL) factors in the comfortable debt coverage and adequate leverage
metrics in FY2024 and FY2025 supported by moderate debt levels and low debt repayments. SIL’s operating income (OI) grew
by 9% YOY in FY 2023 and achieved Rs. 480 crore in 9M FY2024 backed by higher capacity utilisation of the installed capacity
as well as better realisations. In FY2024 and FY2025, ICRA estimates largely similar growth on a YoY basis. The company's total
debt stood at around Rs. 141 crore as of December 2023. Despite its debt funded capex plans, the debt is likely to remain at
moderate levels in medium term. The leverage and coverage indicators are expected to remain comfortable as reflected by
estimated total debt/OPBIDTA of 1.5-1.8 times as of March 2024 and March 2025 (PY: 1.5 times) and debt service coverage
ratio (DSCR) projected to be around 4.5-4.8 times in FY2024 (PY: 7.2 times) and around 3.2-3.5 times in FY2025. The ratings
note the company’s long operational track record of over three decades in the roofing sheets (asbestos cement sheets – AC
sheets) segment, a strong network of over 3,000 dealers and distributors and an established market position in AC sheets in
the western region, mainly Maharashtra and Gujarat. The company is also diversifying across other geographies with deeper
penetration in the southern region.
The ratings, however, remain constrained by the vulnerability of SIL’s revenues and pressure on the margins due to limited
ability to pass on the increase in input costs to its customers as well as the regulatory risks associated with the threat of ban
on use or manufacture of asbestos-related products and the mining of asbestos in asbestos producing countries. The company
deals primarily in asbestos roofing sheet, demand for which remains exposed to demand conditions in the rural economy,
which in turn is dependent on monsoons, minimum support price (MSP) movement and farm productivity. The volumes from
asbestos-related products accounted for 86% of total volumes in H1FY2024. However, the company expects to improve the
share of non-asbestos products over the medium term, which will partially mitigate the regulatory risks. The company is also
exposed to inherent project implementation risks for the ongoing (non-asbestos capacity of 72,000 MTPA at Wada,
Maharashtra with expected CoD of Q4 FY2026) and proposed capex (asbestos corrugated sheets with capacity of 120,000
MTPA at Orissa with expected CoD in FY2028) as well as post-implementation risk related to ramp-up and stabilisation of new
plants. The total capex cost for both plants together is ~Rs. 200 crore and is planned to be funded in debt to equity mix of
75:25. The ratings also factor in the vulnerability of margins to any adverse fluctuations in raw material prices as well as
exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, given considerable imports of asbestos fibre and the absence of any formal
hedging policy. The company’s operating profit margins (OPM) are estimated to moderate to around 10.5%-11% in FY2024
(13.6% in FY2023 and 18.5% in FY2022) due to increase in prices of key raw material. Nonetheless, the operating margins are
expected to marginally improve in FY2025 with likely moderation in raw material prices. The ratings also take into account the
working capital-intensive nature of SIL’s operations given the high inventory requirements.

The Stable outlook on the rating reflects ICRA’s expectations that SIL will continue to benefit from the established market
position in the AC sheet industry in western India supporting its revenues and the company is likely to sustain comfortable
debt coverage metrics.
Key rating drivers and their description
Credit strengths
Comfortable debt coverage and adequate leverage metrics – The company's total debt stood at around Rs. 141 crore as of
December 2023. Despite its debt funded capex plans, the debt is likely to remain at moderate levels in medium term. The
leverage and coverage indicators are expected to remain comfortable as reflected by estimated total debt/OPBIDTA of 1.5-1.8
times as of March 2024 and March 2025 (PY: 1.5 times) and DSCR of around 4.5-4.8 times in FY2024 (PY: 7.2 times) and around
3.2-3.5 times in FY2025.
Established market position in roofing segment; wide distribution network – SIL has a strong network comprising over 3,000
dealers and distributors. It has an established market position in AC sheets in the western region, mainly Maharashtra and
Gujarat, with three plants located in the same region. Further, the company has plans to diversify across other geographies
with deeper penetration in the southern region, where it has some presence.
Long track record of operations – SIL has a track record of over three decades in the roofing sheets (asbestos cement sheets
– AC sheets) segment. The company sells building material products and accessories under the brands ‘Swastik’, ‘Cemply’ and
‘Ecopro’, among others.
Credit challenges
Operations remain exposed to regulatory risks – The ratings remain constrained by the vulnerability of SIL’s revenues and
pressure on the margins due to limited ability to pass on the increase in input costs to its customers as well as the regulatory
risks associated with the threat of ban on use or manufacture of asbestos-related products and the mining of asbestos in
asbestos-producing countries. The revenues from asbestos-related products accounted for 86% of its total revenues in H1
FY2024. However, the company expects to improve the share of non-asbestos products over the medium term, which will
partially mitigate the regulatory risks.
Operating margins exposed to fluctuations in raw material prices and foreign exchange rates; working capital-intensive
nature of operations – The ratings also factor in the vulnerability of SIL’s margins to any adverse fluctuations in raw material
prices as well as exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, given the considerable imports of asbestos fibre and the
absence of any formal hedging policy. Its exports, though moderate, provide natural hedging against the imports to an extent.
The company’s operating profit margins (OPM) are estimated to moderate to around 10.5%-11% in FY2024 (13.6% in FY2023
and 18.5% in FY2022) due to increase in prices of key raw material prices. Nonetheless, the operating margins are expected
to marginally improve in FY2025 with likely moderation in raw material prices. The ratings also take into account the working
capital-intensive nature of SIL’s operations given the high inventory requirements.
Vulnerability of demand to cyclicality in rural markets – The company deals primarily in asbestos roofing sheet. The demand
for the same remains exposed to demand conditions in the rural economy, which in turn is dependent on monsoons, minimum
support price (MSP) movement and farm productivity. SIL’s operating income (OI) grew by 9% YOY in FY 2023 and achieved
Rs. 480 crore in 9M FY2024 backed by higher capacity utilisation of the installed capacity as well as better realisations. In
FY2024 and FY2025, ICRA estimates largely similar growth on a YoY basis. The company is also exposed to inherent project
implementation risks for the ongoing (non-asbestos capacity of 72,000 MTPA at Wada, Maharashtra with expected CoD of Q4
FY2026) and proposed capex (asbestos corrugated sheets with capacity of 120,000 MTPA at Orissa with expected CoD in
FY2028) as well as post-implementation risk related to ramp-up and stabilisation of new plants. Any adverse movements in
the demand for SIL’s products from the rural markets could impact the revenue base and, thus, its profitability.

Environmental and social risks
While some forms of asbestos fibre pose health risks to individuals who are exposed, asbestos cement manufactured using
white chrysotile asbestos is of relatively low risk. All manufacturers are required to follow strict environmental norms to
operate. Given the safety and environmental health-related concerns associated with asbestos, the industry may be vulnerable
to the risk of tightening regulatory norms. Any ban on the mining of asbestos across countries may expose the company to risk
of non-availability of raw material. Any ban on the usage of asbestos due to environmental or health concerns could have a
significant impact on the operation of AC Sheets segment, which is one of the major contributors to SIL’s operating profits.
Liquidity position: Adequate
SIL’s liquidity position remains adequate supported by free cash and liquid investments of Rs. 13.8 crore as on December 31,
2023 and moderate utilisation of fund-based limits (~38% for past 12 months ending December 31, 2023) with an average
cushion of ~ Rs. 100 crore. Further, the company plans to undertake capex of ~Rs. 150 crore (towards Wada and Orissa plants)
over the next 3 years in FY2025-FY2027, which is expected to be partially funded by debt and the remaining through internal
accruals. The debt tie-up for Wada plant is in place. The company has low debt repayments of around Rs. 10.5 crore in FY2025
which can be comfortably met from its cash flow from operations.
Rating sensitivities
Positive factors – ICRA could upgrade SIL’s ratings, if there is any significant growth in revenues and profitability, coupled with
an improvement in debt coverage metrics and liquidity, on a sustained basis.
Negative factors – The ratings could be downgraded, if the entity shows any significant decline in its revenue base or witnesses
a deterioration in profitability, affecting its liquidity position. Any larger-than-anticipated debt-funded capex, leading to Total
Debt/OPBDIT of more than 2.3 times, on a sustained basis, could also result in a rating downgrade.

Rationale
The revision of the outlook on Anuh Pharma Limited’s (APL) long-term rating to Positive factors in its improved business and
revenue outlook, driven by capacity enhancements and the launch of new products. Following a 400 MT capacity enhancement
in FY2024, driven by strong demand for its products, the company further enhanced its capacities of active pharmaceutical
ingredients (API) to 2,200MT from 1,800MT in the current fiscal, funded through internal accruals. This is expected to support
the company’s revenue growth and product diversification over the medium term. The ratings favourably consider APL’s
healthy financial profile and the expectation of its continuation in FY2025, supported by steady performance with limited
reliance on debt, leading to robust debt protection metrics. The company’s liquidity position is also strong, underpinned by
healthy unencumbered cash and liquid investments of Rs. 49.4 crore and non-current investments of Rs. 51.9 crore as on
September 30, 2024, against a total debt of Rs. 14.1 crore (including lease liabilities).
APL reported a healthy YoY revenue growth of 23% in FY2024, driven by healthy demand for bulk drugs, enhancement in
manufacturing capacity to 1,500 MTPA from 1,200 MTPA. This expansion also contributed to an improvement in the operating
profit margin to 11.8% in FY2024 from 10.2% in FY2023. The company reported a marginal YoY decline in growth in H1 FY2025
due to a combination of declining realisations and a shift in its volume offtakes for regulatory markets (which typically fetch
higher realisations) to H2 FY2025. That said, with the expected pickup in demand for its high-margin products in H2 FY2025,
the company is likely to report overall steady performance in FY2025 in comparison to FY2024. While erythromycin and its
salts continue to account for ~32-33% of APL’s revenues, ICRA notes the company’s endeavour towards gradual diversification
of product portfolio through its R&D efforts.
The ratings, however, remain constrained by APL’s growing, although relatively moderate scale of operations with a product
profile of mature and commoditised molecules, exposing its profit margins to price-based competition. Furthermore, APL
remains exposed to regulatory and foreign exchange (forex) risks due to the nature of its operations. The company also remains
exposed to concentration risks, with company operating out of a single manufacturing facility in Boisar (Maharashtra).

Key rating drivers and their description
Credit strengths
Established track record in API manufacturing - APL has been manufacturing APIs since 1989 with a product portfolio of
erythromycin and salts and higher macrolides like azithromycin, roxithromycin, pyrazinamide and chloramphenicol. As per the
company, it occupies a healthy share in the global market for its key products and is among the leaders in erythromycin
and its salts.
Healthy financial risk profile - Aided by adequate retained cash flows and unencumbered cash and liquid investments, APL’s
dependence on external debt has remained limited. As on March 31, 2024, APL’s total debt of Rs. 2.7 crore includes a short-
term debt of Rs. 2 crore and lease liabilities of Rs. 0.7 crore. Further, the company maintained its cash surplus status, with
unencumbered cash and liquid investments of Rs. 49.4 crore and non-current investments of Rs. 51.9 crore as on September
30, 2024. Its debt coverage indicators also remained robust, as evidenced by interest coverage of 79.5 times and debt service
coverage ratio (DSCR) of 68.3 times in FY2024.
Improved business outlook – APL reported healthy growth of 23% in FY2024, driven by healthy demand for bulk drugs and an
increase in API manufacturing capacity to 1,500 MT from the earlier 1,200 MT. This expansion was undertaken by technological
upgrades along with market penetration and geographical expansion, as demand rose for its anti‐malarial, corticosteroids and
macrolides products. The business outlook for APL remains healthy, led by capacity enhancements and the launch of new
products. Owing to strong demand for its products, the company further enhanced its capacities of active pharmaceutical
ingredients (API) to 2200MT from 1800MT in the current fiscal, funded through internal accruals. This is expected to support
APL’s revenue growth and product diversification over the medium term. Further, APL has obtained the certification of
suitability (CEP) for glicazide and azithromycin from European Directorate for Quality Medicine (EDQM). With this approval,
the opportunity for sales in the European market and institutional business is expected to open up. Also, new products such
as Ticagrelor, Dapagliflozin, Empagliflozin, Bilastine HCI, Pyronaridine Tetraphosphate and Vonoprazon Fumarate are at the
development stage, which is expected to further diversify APL’s product profile.
Credit challenges
Moderate, albeit growing, scale of operations – The company remains a moderate size player in the bulk drug industry despite
the sustained growth in scale of operations in FY2024. The company reported a marginal YoY decline in growth for H1 FY2025
due to a combination of declining realisations and a shift in its volume offtake for the regulatory markets (which typically fetch
higher realisations) to H2 FY2025. That said, with the expected pickup in demand for its high-margin products in H2 FY2025,
the company is likely to report overall steady performance in FY2025 in comparison to FY2024. Timely receipt of regulatory
approvals for its new products to further diversify its product profile will remain an important driver for revenues and profit
margins and will remain critical for the credit perspective on an ongoing basis. The company also remains exposed to
concentration risks, as it operates from a single manufacturing facility in Boisar (Maharashtra).
Product profile of mature and commoditised products exposes APL to intense price-based competition - APL’s dominant
product profile comprises mature and commoditised molecules, including erythromycin, pyrazinamide and corticosteroids,
which exposes it to intense price-based competition. Given the commoditised nature, the margin remains susceptible to raw
material movements and product sales mix, which is also reflected by margin fluctuations witnessed on a quarterly basis.
Exposure to regulatory and forex risks owing to nature of operations - APL caters to regulated markets like Western Europe
and semi-regulated markets like West Asia, Latin America and Southern Europe. The company holds CEP, World Health
Organization Good Manufacturing Practices (WHO GMP), Federal Committee for Protection from Sanitary Risks (COFEPRIS-
Mexico) and European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & Healthcare (EDQM) certifications for manufacturing various
bulk drugs, which are reviewed on a periodic basis by the respective regulatory agencies. Moreover, the company is yet to
receive approval from Pharma Copia (Japan). Following receipt of the approval, APL would be catering to the Japanese market
as well. Any suspension of these certifications can impact its exports to these regulated and semi-regulated markets, as

witnessed in FY2017. Further, the company will require regulatory approvals for its enhanced capacity in FY2025. The
company’s profit margins also remain vulnerable to forex fluctuations on account of its export operations.
Environmental and Social Risks
Environmental considerations – APL does not face any major physical climate risk. However, it remains exposed to tightening
environmental regulations for breach of waste and pollution norms, which can lead to an increase in operating costs and new
capacity instalment costs. This can also require capital investments to upgrade its effluent treatment infrastructure to reduce
its carbon footprint and waste generation. However, APL has constantly been making efforts to minimise the impact of
environmental risks on its operations. The company successfully commissioned its new expansion project in November 2024
after receiving environmental clearance from the State Government of Maharashtra. It adopts relevant techniques and
methods, such as safety audits and periodic assessments for environmental, health and safety risks and takes all the required
remedial measures, as and when needed, impacting the business positively. The company has also commissioned zero liquid
discharge (ZLD) for the effluent treatment plant.
Social considerations – The industry faces social risks related to product safety and associated litigation risk, access to qualified
personnel for R&D and process engineering, and maintenance of high manufacturing compliance standards. However, the
company has also adopted an environment, health and safety policy. Further, Government intervention related to price caps/
control also remains a social risk faced by entities in the pharmaceutical industry. However, the company takes all the required
regulatory approvals/ certificates before introducing any new products in the market. The company holds CEP, WHO GMP1,
COFEPRIS2 (Mexico) and EDQM certifications for manufacturing various bulk drugs, which are reviewed on a periodic basis by
the respective regulatory agencies.
Liquidity position: Strong
The company’s liquidity profile is strong, underpinned by healthy free cash and liquid investments of Rs. 49.4 crore, and non-
current investments of Rs. 51.9 crore as on September 30, 2024. Coupled with largely unutilised working capital limits, these
provide a strong liquidity cushion. Against this, the company does not have any long-term debt obligations (except lease
liabilities), nor any plans to incur debt-funded capital expenditure (capex) in the near term.
Rating sensitivities
Positive factors – APL’s ratings may be upgraded if it significantly improves its scale of operations and profitability along with
diversification of its product portfolio.
Negative factors – The ratings would be revised to Stable if the ramp-up of enhanced capacity is slower than expected, exerting
pressure on profitability. Pressure on the ratings could arise in case the company’s operating margins fall below 7% on a
sustained basis. Any regulatory non-compliance issued to APL for its products and/or manufacturing facilities that could impact
its revenues and profitability, would also be a negative rating trigger. Further, any large debt-funded capex exerting pressure
on the company’s credit metrics or any significant weakening of the liquidity position would be negative triggers as well.

Rating Rationale Rating Rationale April 26, 2024 | Mumbai Euro India Fresh Foods LimitedRatings reaffirmed at 'CRISIL B+/Stable/CRISIL A4' Rating ActionTotal Bank Loan Facilities RatedRs.45 CroreLong Term RatingCRISIL B+/Stable (Reaffirmed)Short Term RatingCRISIL A4 (Reaffirmed)Note: None of the Directors on CRISIL Ratings Limited’s Board are members of rating committee and thus do not participate in discussion or assignment of any ratings. The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities Detailed Rationale CRISIL Ratings has reaffirmed its ‘CRISIL B+/Stable/CRISIL A4’ ratings on the bank facilities of Euro India Fresh Foods Ltd (Euro). The ratings continue to reflect susceptibility to volatility in agro commodity prices and high sales promotional activities, and exposure to intense competition and large working capital requirement. These weaknesses are partially offset by the extensive experience of the promoters in the packaged foods industry, the diversified product portfolio of the company along with established brand and a moderate financial risk profile. Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description Weaknesses: Susceptibility to volatility in agro commodity prices and high sales promotional activities, and exposure to intense competition: The company is highly dependent on the domestic production of potatoes and other agro commodities. Domestic production is dependent on the area under cultivation, monsoon, prices of other crops, and minimum support price (MSP) and other incentives offered by the government of India. All these factors determine the prices of crops. To overcome seasonality and price volatility risks, Euro procures and stores raw materials during the peak season when products are available at affordable prices. This partially offsets the price volatility risk but leads to large inventory. Operating margin remained at an average of 6.11% in the five fiscal years through 2023 and is expected to improve over the medium term with reduction in sales and promotional activities. Although there is a large market and demand for potato chips and other snacks, Euro faces strong competition from other established brands, such as Lays, Kurkure, Parle wafers, Balaji wafers, Uncle Chips, Haldiram’s and Bingo. Furthermore, Euro is a modest player compared with the manufacturers of these brands and is vulnerable to competitive pressures it faces from the bigger players. However, revenue had improved in fiscal 2023, however, expected to remain moderate in fiscal 2024 on account of high competition. Large working capital requirement: Gross current assets (GCAs) were at 219 days as on March 31, 2023, driven by inventory and receivables of 169 days and 59 days, respectively. Moderation in inventory, resulting in improvement in the working capital cycle, will remain a key rating sensitivity factor. Strengths: Extensive experience of the promoters and diversified product portfolio with established brand: The promoters have experience of over 10 years in the packaged foods industry; this has helped them develop understanding of industry and market dynamics. The company sells through an extensive network of distributors and retailers as well as its own stores. It exports to the US, the UK and the Gulf countries. The company manufactures products such as potato chips, fried extruded snacks, namkeens, mineral water and core filling snacks, thus limiting its dependence on a product category. It sells its products under the brand Euro. It has an established distribution network across four states, including Maharashtra and Gujarat. Moderate financial risk profile: The financial risk profile is supported by healthy capital structure and adequate debt protection metrics. Networth and total outside liabilities to adjusted networth ratio were Rs 64.5 crore and 0.89 time, respectively, as on March 31, 2023. Debt protection metrics were comfortable, as indicated by interest coverage and net cash accrual to adjusted debt ratios of 2.30 times and 0.10 time, respectively, in fiscal 2023. The financial risk profile will remain healthy over the medium term despite debt-funded capital expenditure (capex) plan and steady accretion to reserve. Liquidity: Stretched Bank limit utilisation was high at 99.51% for the 12 months through January 2024. Cash accrual, expected at Rs 4.8-7.0 crore per annum, will sufficiently cover yearly term debt obligation of Rs 3.6 crore over the medium term. In addition, surplus will cushion the liquidity. Current ratio was healthy at 2.06 times as on March 31, 2023. Low gearing and moderate networth support financial flexibility, which will help withstand adverse conditions or downturns in the business. Outlook: Stable CRISIL Ratings believes Euro will continue to benefit from its diversified product portfolio and established brand. Rating Sensitivity factors Upward factors Increase in revenue and stable operating margin leading to cash accrual above Rs 5 crore Efficient working capital management with moderation in inventory Sustenance of financial risk profile with improvement in liquidity Downward factors Decline in revenue or fall in operating margin below 4% leading to lower cash accrual Further stretch in the working capital cycle or large debt-funded capex or higher borrowing cost, weakening the financial risk profile or liquidity About the Company Incorporated in fiscal 2009, Euro manufactures potato chips, fried extruded snacks, salted snacks (namkeen), mineral water and core filling snacks in Surat, Gujarat, and markets them under the brand Euro. The company is promoted by Mr Manhar Sanspara and his family members. It is listed on the National Stock Exchange. The company is setting up a plant in Chikhli, Gujarat, with similar capacity, which will be operationalised in a phased manner.

Rationale and key rating drivers
Ratings assigned to bank facilities of The Western India Plywoods Limited (WIPL) continue to derive strength from the
promoters’ vast experience and long operational track record for more than seven decades, WIPL’s presence as a niche
player in the domestic hardboard industry, diversified product profile and customer base, and healthy financial risk profile.
However, ratings continue to be constrained by profit margins susceptible to volatile raw material prices and forex risk,
exposure to subsidiaries and competition from the unorganised segment.
Rating sensitivities: Factors likely to lead to rating actions
Positive factors
• Growing scale of operations marked by increasing total operating income (TOI) to above ₹150 crore.
• Sustained improvement in profitability margin to a range of 9% to 10%.
Negative factors
• Debt-funded capex deteriorating the capital structure leading to gearing to above 1x.
Analytical approach: Standalone
Outlook: Stable
The stable outlook reflects that the company is expected to sustain its financial and operational performance in the long-
term deriving benefits from the promoters’ vast experience and long track record of the group.
Detailed description of key rating drivers
Key strengths
Vast experience of promoters and operational track record of more than seven decades
P K Mayan Mohammad (present MD and grandson of the founder Late A. K. Kaderkutty) has been associated with WIPL
since 1992 and takes care of the company’s day-to-day operations. Since its inception in 1945, WIPL has expanded its
operations by diversifying into manufacturing hardboard, plywood, densified wood, pre-compressed board, and softboard.
WIPL was the first company to manufacture hardboard in India and it continues to be the market leader in the domestic
hardboard industry. WIPL’s R&D department is approved by the Department of Science & Industrial Research, Ministry of
Science & Technology, Government of India.
Niche player in the domestic hardboard industry backed by diversified customer base
WIPL is one of India’s leading manufacturers of hardboard, and the ‘WIP’ brand is well identified and recognised in the
market. In addition, value-added products like densified molded seats for auditorium, restaurants and engineered wood
flooring have enabled the company to reinforce its image as a quality manufacturer. Being one of the oldest players in the
industry, WIPL enjoys a strong and diversified customer base with the top five customers contributing 14.6% of total sales
in FY24 and 15.7% in Q1FY25. A major portion of the company’s sales are derived from the hardboard segment (45.8%
in FY24 and 42.88% in Q1FY25) in which the company has an established presence. Due to its characteristic properties,
hardboard is widely used in chemical packing industries and automobile industry for manufacturing interiors of automobiles.

Press Release
Diversified product mix backed by flexibility in production
WIPL has an integrated wood complex, and its integrated nature of operations enables WIPL to use the same raw material
namely firewood/ timber logs/veneer to manufacture different end products based on market and per customer
requirement. This gives WIPL flexibility to manufacture products such as plywood, densified wood and sub segments in
these products in specifications ranging from as low as 2mm to 25mm thickness. The units in the plant are engineered to
produce both softboard and hardboard as the first process of production alone differs for both the products and the rest
of the processes are almost the same. WIPL also has an in-house R&D department, which works on coming up with newer
variations of the above products and improving overall quality.
Stable operational performance in FY24
The scale of operations has remained stable with TOI of ₹108.22 crore (PY: ₹107.35 crore) in FY24. The operating cycle
of the company improved in FY24 to 96 days (PY: 107 days) primarily considering improvement in the inventory period
which stood at 53 days in FY24 as against 62 days in FY23. The company booked income of ₹24.93 crore in Q1FY25 (refers
to April 01 to June 30), against ₹23.49 crore in Q1FY24. The company posted a PBILDT margin of 7.48% (PY: 7.87%) in
FY24 and 4.09% in Q1FY25 against 5.6% in Q1FY24. The decline in margin is due to the higher repair expenses incurred
in March 2024 and April 2024 due to the unexpected breakdown of machinery. The company has increased its softboard
capacity on the back of increasing demand in the segment and is expecting growth from this segment in upcoming years.
In FY24, the company registered a 95% growth in value and 82% growth in volume against FY23 in the softboard segment.
In the plywood segment, the company is focusing on premium variants to drive growth and improve profitability.
Healthy capital structure and comfortable debt coverage metrics
WIPL’s capital structure stood healthy with overall gearing of 0.31x as on March 31, 2024 (PY: 0.36x) with minimal reliance
on working capital limits. The total debt to gross cash accrual (TDGCA) ratio also stood improved at 2.76x as on March 31,
2024 (PY: 3.03). The interest coverage also stood comfortable at 6.43x in FY24 (PY: 5.84x).
Key weaknesses
Profit margins susceptible to raw material price and forex risk
The primary raw material for manufacturing hardboard is softwood (firewood). For manufacturing plywood, the company
depends on timber logs and veneers, with veneer being imported from its Malaysian subsidiary. The firewood and timber
logs prices are volatile based on their availability. The company is also exposed to forex risk as it imports a part of its raw
materials. However, since the company exports softboards and imports raw material in the same currency, there is a
natural hedge in place to a considerable extent.
Exposure to subsidiaries
WIPL has four operating subsidiaries: Kohinoor Sawmill Ltd (KSM), Southern Veneers and Woodworks Limited (SVWL),
Era & WIP Timber JV SDN BHD (ERA), and Mayabandar Doors Limited (MDL). KSM, SVWL, and MDL do job work for WIPL,
while ERA supplies veneer for WIPL’s production. Overall gearing adjusted for exposure to the subsidiaries stood at 0.40x
as on March 31, 2024 (PY: 0.46x). All the domestic subsidiaries are engaged in doing job work for WIPL and major portion
of their sales are to WIPL.
Liquidity: Adequate
The company’s liquidity is adequate, marked by sufficient expected cash accruals of ₹5.5-6.5 crore in FY25 as against loan
repayments of ₹1.19 crore. The company had cash and bank balance of ₹9.22 crore as on March 31, 2024. The current
ratio stood comfortable at 2.52x. WIPL’s nature of business requires a wide range of finished stock to be held as inventory
due to diverse product offerings of categories. Operating cycle improved to 96 days (PY: 107 days). WIPL has working
capital limits of ₹12.00 crore, the average utilisation of which stood at 9.9% in the 12 months ending July 2024.

Rating Rationale Rating Rationale July 05, 2024 | Mumbai Music Broadcast LimitedRatings reaffirmed at 'CRISIL AA/Stable/CRISIL A1+' Rating ActionTotal Bank Loan Facilities RatedRs.135 CroreLong Term RatingCRISIL AA/Stable (Reaffirmed)Short Term RatingCRISIL A1+ (Reaffirmed) Rs.120 Crore Preference SharesCRISIL AA/Stable (Reaffirmed)Note: None of the Directors on CRISIL Ratings Limited’s Board are members of rating committee and thus do not participate in discussion or assignment of any ratings. The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities Detailed Rationale CRISIL Ratings has reaffirmed its ‘CRISIL AA/Stable/CRISIL A1+’ ratings on the bank facilities and preference shares of Music Broadcast Ltd (MBL). The ratings continue to reflect the managerial, operational and financial linkages with the parent, Jagran Prakashan Ltd (JPL; ‘CRISIL AA+/Stable/CRISIL A1+’), healthy market position of MBL in the FM radio broadcasting industry and strong financial risk profile. These strengths are partially offset by susceptibility to economic activity and moderate competition. CRISIL Ratings has taken note of the ongoing litigation amongst the promoters of JPL. MBL and Midday Infomedia Ltd (MIL; ‘CRISIL AA-/Stable’) are subsidiaries of JPL and collectively referred herein as the Jagran group (JPL group). Mr Mahendra Mohan Gupta (Chairman of JPL) along with Mr Shailesh Gupta (Whole-time Director of JPL) and VRSM Enterprises LLP (collectively, the petitioners) had filed an oppression petition before the National Company Law Tribunal, Allahabad, on July 10, 2023. The petitioners have 16.18% shareholding in Jagran Media Network Investment Pvt Ltd (JMNIPL), which holds 67.97% shareholding in JPL. The petitioners’ indirect and direct shareholding in JPL aggregates to 11.29. The shareholding of JMNIPL is completely held by the members of the Gupta family, which includes the petitioners. The petition raises issues concerning oppression of the minority shareholders i.e., the petitioners, by the majority shareholders i.e., the other members of the Gupta family, both at the JMNIPL and the JPL levels. However, the petition does not allege any mismanagement in the affairs of JPL. CRISIL Ratings understands that at this juncture, the outcome of this litigation is unlikely to have any material financial implications and should not have any material impact on the credit risk profiles of the group companies that are rated by CRISIL Ratings, i.e., JPL, MBL and MIL. However, CRISIL Ratings will continue to closely monitor the developments around the same. Any adverse outcome impacting the credit risk profiles of these rated entities will remain a key rating sensitivity factor. MBL has completed the bonus issue of around Rs 90 crore of non-convertible redeemable preference shares to its non-promoter shareholders during the quarter ending March 31, 2023. These are to be redeemed three years from the issue date with a redemption premium of ~Rs 18 crore. CRISIL Ratings understands that MBL will service preference share dividend as well as the redemption amount in a timely manner. Analytical Approach CRISIL Ratings has considered the standalone financials of MBL and has applied its parent notch-up framework to factor in the strong operational, financial and managerial linkages between MBL and JPL. Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description Strengths: Established linkages with JPL: MBL has helped JPL diversify its reach into the radio broadcasting segment and, thus, remains strategically important to the latter. It complements the print business of JPL and enables it to offer a strong and differentiated product to advertisers. It further enhances the geographical reach by adding cities where JPL has limited presence in print. Furthermore, radio stations of MBL, acquired during the phase III auctions, are in areas where JPL has a strong reach, thereby providing synergies to the former. In the past, JPL had facilitated the issuance of non-convertible debentures by providing a corporate guarantee to MBL, and later replaced it with a letter of comfort. It also offered liquidity support through a debt service reserve account, covering six months of debt obligation. The extensive experience of JPL’s management in the media and entertainment business will continue to strengthen the business risk profile. Healthy market position and healthy financial risk profile: The JPL group has 39 radio channels, under the established Radio City brand. It is the second largest radio player with estimated ~20% volume market share in the last quarter of fiscal 2024. This helps complement JPL’s offering to advertisers. It has a diversified geographical presence with strong presence in tier 2 and tier 3 cities. Focus on growth in non-free commercial time revenue, such as digital and events, will aid revenue diversification. The financial risk profile will remain supported by strong liquidity with cash and liquid investments of around Rs 327 crore as on March 31, 2024. The financial risk profile should remain healthy over the medium term, driven by improvement in cash accrual. Weakness: Susceptibility to economic activity and moderate competition: Operating performance of radio operators remains vulnerable to economic downturns, as ad revenue is linked to the overall macroeconomic scenario. Recovery in ad revenue will continue to be a key monitorable. Moreover, limited scope to differentiate offerings results in price-led competition amongst radio players, for the available advertising revenue. Liquidity: Strong Liquidity is supported by cash and liquid investments of around Rs 327 crore against debt of around Rs 92 crore as on March 31, 2024. Capital expenditure (capex) is expected to remain moderate. Furthermore, MBL has high financial flexibility and can get support from its parent, JPL, in case of any exigencies. Outlook: Stable MBL will continue to benefit from the healthy market position of Radio City, strong liquidity and linkages with JPL. Rating Sensitivity factors Upward factors Upgrade in the credit rating of JPL by 1 notch Strong revenue growth leading to healthy cash accrual and return on capital employed ratio Downward factors Change in stated stance of support from JPL Downgrade in the credit rating of JPL by 1 or more notches Sustained decline in operating revenue, impacting profitability and cash accrual Any adverse outcome of the ongoing litigation amongst the promoters leading to significant impact on the credit risk profile About the Company MBL was the first private FM radio broadcaster in India; it operates FM radio channels under the Radio City brand. In fiscal 2016, the company acquired 11 new stations in batch I of FM phase III auctions. Also, eight radio stations under the Radio Mantra brand, operated by promoters of JPL under Shri Puran Multimedia Ltd, were merged with the company and rebranded as Radio City in fiscal 2016. The company is present in 39 cities across India. It also operates 17 web-based stations. About the Group The group is a media conglomerate with interests spanning printing and publication of newspapers and magazines, FM radio, digital, outdoor advertising and promotional marketing, event management and activation businesses. JPL is the flagship company of the JPL group that is based in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. The group publishes 10 publications from 13 states/union territories in five different languages. JPL acquired MIL in a 2:7 equity-swap ratio in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2016, the JPL group acquired MBL, which has grown to 39 stations and 15 online stations.

Press Release
Almondz Global Securities Limited
October 03, 2024
Facilities/Instruments Amount (₹ crore) Rating1 Rating Action
Long Term Bank Facilities 5.00 CARE BBB-; Stable Reaffirmed
Details of instruments/facilities in Annexure-1.
Rationale and key rating drivers
CARE Ratings Limited (CARE Ratings) has conducted the rating assessment of Almondz Global Securities Limited (AGSL) based
on the consolidated approach of AGSL and its subsidiaries; hereinafter referred to as ‘Group’.
The reaffirmation in the rating assigned of the bank facilities of AGSL continue to derive strength from group’s established
presence in capital market related business and increasing presence in infrastructure related and other business segments. The
rating also continues to derive comfort from the moderate financial risk profile of the group characterized by growth in revenue
with marginal moderation in profitability margins reported during FY24 (refers to period April 01 to March 31), comfortable overall
gearing with improved albeit moderate debt coverage indicators. The rating, however, continue to remain constrained by the
group’s dependence on infrastructure consultancy and green fuel business with majority of revenue coming from infrastructure
advisory through Almondz Global Infra Consultant Limited (AGICL) while profitability and cash generation is derived from green
fuel business through Premier Green Innovations Private Limited (PGIPL). The rating also continues to remain constrained on
account of working capital-intensive nature of operations indicated by elongated collection period and dependence upon timely
execution of projects.
Rating sensitivities: Factors likely to lead to rating actions
Positive factors
• Growth in overall scale of operations above 20% from existing level with sustenance in operating margin above 15%.
• Improvement in average collection period to less than 90 days on a sustained basis.
Negative factors
• Decline in scale of operations from existing level and moderation in operating margins below 8%.
• Elongation in average collection period to beyond 200 days leading to deterioration in liquidity position of the company.
• Deterioration in the capital structure with overall gearing ratio beyond 0.60x on a sustained basis
• Any delays in project execution impacting the financial performance and liquidity position of the company.
Analytical approach: Consolidated, on account of strong financial and management linkages with its subsidiaries, collectively
represented as ‘Almondz Group’. The list of subsidiaries considered for consolidation is given in Annexure-6.
Outlook: Stable
Stable outlook reflects CARE’s opinion of expected improvement in turnover and profitability of the group in near to medium term
led by ramp up of operations in subsidiary companies, sustained healthy margins and low external debt in the group.
Detailed description of key rating drivers:
Key strengths
Established presence in capital market and infrastructure related business segment
Incorporated in 1994, AGSL has more than two decades of track record of operations in the financial & capital market related
business such as advisory and consulting in the area of debt & equity capital market, broking in equity, commodity and debt
market, distribution of financial products and trading and investment in debt market. The group has also increased its presence
in infrastructure advisory through AGICL. Around 80% of the business for AGICL is generated through government contracts,
which are executed by AGICL either solely, through JVs or through associate companies. Majority of the revenue of the group
emanates from advisory/consultancy and broking business with 81% of revenue in FY24 as against 79% revenue in FY23.
1Complete definition of ratings assigned are available at www.careedge.in and other CARE Ratings Limited’s publications.
1 CARE Ratings Ltd.
Press Release
Growing scale of operations with moderate profitability margins
During FY24, the company on a consolidated basis reported a growth of ~49% in total operating income to Rs. 114.10 crore over
Rs. 76.51 in FY23, the growth is largely contributed by AGICL, owing to better order execution during the year. AGSL (on
consolidated basis) reported PBILDT margin of 11.91% in FY24 as against margin of 12.88% in FY23. The PBILDT margin slightly
moderated in FY24 on account of increase in the professional fees paid to consultants. The PAT margins improved from 20.62%
in FY23 to 29.86% in FY24, largely on account of exceptional income of Rs. 15.75 crores booked by the company on sale of
subsidiary (Almondz Finanz Limited) to Avonmore on December 31, 2023. The company reported TOI of Rs. 29.65 crores with
PBILDT of Rs. 8.43 crores in Q1FY25 (refers to period April 01 to June 30).
Comfortable capital structure
The capital structure of the company remains comfortable with overall gearing of 0.11x as on March 31, 2024 (PY: 0.10x) as
AGSL largely remains equity funded and there is no plan to raise additional borrowings. The debt coverage indicators stood
satisfactory with interest coverage and total debt/GCA ratio of 3.51x and 0.62x in FY24 stands improved from 2.04x and 1.13x
respectively during FY23. The financial risk profile of the group is expected to remain comfortable in the near to medium term as
there is no major capex or term debt planned in near future.
Key weaknesses
Dependence on infrastructure consultancy and green fuel business
AGSL, on consolidated level, the AGSL generates maximum revenue from infrastructure segment contributing around 60-62% of
revenue which largely comes from AGICL. It is followed by debt & equity market operations and wealth broking activities which
contribute ~20% to the overall revenue of the group. Net profitability of the company is supported by profit share (~22% on
consolidated level) from green fuel business through joint venture entity Premier Green Innovations Private Limited in which AGSL
holds 46.34% equity shares.
Elongated working capital cycle in infrastructure advisory business
The company on consolidated level generates majority of revenue from infrastructure consultancy segment through AGICL, which
involves larger collection period as majority of business is coming from government counterparties (~around 80%) leading to
relatively longer time in ultimate recovery of infrastructure advisory fees in the government sector projects. However, to mitigate
the same, the company has been focusing on increasing the proportion of private sector projects which involves shorter collection
period. Average collection period reported at 146 days as on March 31, 2024 (PY: 161 days) and operating cycle stood elongated
at 66 days as on March 31, 2024, though improved from 100 days as on March 31, 2023, owing to improved collection period
from 161 days as on March 31, 2023, to 146 days as on March 31, 2024 & improved average inventory period of 59 days (PY:78
days). The company manages its working capital requirements through internal accruals and sanctioned fund- based limit (FDOD)
of Rs.2.85 crores having an average utilization of ~65% for the trailing twelve months ending with June 30, 2024.
Dependence upon timely execution of projects
The revenue profile of the group being largely derived from AGICL is dependent upon smooth and timely execution of
infrastructure projects like roads, bridges, tunnels etc. has inherent risk of delay in execution due to site hand over, weather
conditions and issues related to availability of labour etc. which may result in time and cost overrun in the projects. However, the
long industry experience of promoters in infra consultancy business mitigates these risks to some extent.
Liquidity: Adequate
The liquidity position of the group is adequate marked by expected GCA of ~Rs.28-30 crore as against the nominal repayment
obligation of Rs.1-2 crore. Liquidity position is also supported by a favourable capital structure for the group (Gearing of 0.11x as
on March 31, 2024). AGSL (on a consolidated level) has liquidity (cash and bank balance) of ~Rs.25.28 crore as on March 31,
2024. The overall utilisation of working capital limits also remains comfortable. Given, comfortable gearing levels and comfortable
working capital utilisation, the liquidity position of the company is expected to be adequate.

220.50
Long Term / Short Term Bank Facilities CARE BBB+; Stable / CARE A3+ Reaffirmed
(Enhanced from 84.50)
Details of instruments/facilities in Annexure-1.
Rationale and key rating drivers
The reaffirmation of ratings assigned to the bank facilities of SRM Contractors Limited (SRM) factor in growing scale of operations
driven by better execution of orders in hand, strong revenue visibility supported by healthy order book position and comfortable
financial risk profile, bolstered by successful fundraising through its initial public offering (IPO). Further, the ratings also derive
strength from experience of the promoters, company’s long track record in project execution, established market position in the
Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) of construction of roads/bridges/tunnels on higher altitudes. However, the
ratings are constrained on account of highly fragmented and competitive construction industry, inherent execution risks related
to projects, working capital intensive nature of operations and geographical concentrated order book position.
Rating sensitivities: Factors likely to lead to rating actions
Positive factors
• Growth in total operating income (TOI) above Rs. 800 crores and profit before interest, lease rentals, depreciation and
taxation (PBILDT) margin above 16% with improvement and diversification in order book position on a sustained basis.
• Efficient working capital management thereby further improving the liquidity profile of the company.
Negative factors
• Decline in scale of operations by more than 20% from existing levels and moderation in operating margins below 12% on
sustained basis
• Elongation in average collection period beyond 90 days and further elongation in gross current assets days adversely
impacting liquidity position of the company.
• Deterioration in the capital structure with overall gearing ratio beyond 0.75x on a sustained basis.
• Any delays in project execution impacting the financial performance and liquidity position of the company.
Analytical approach: Standalone
Outlook: Stable
The ‘Stable’ outlook indicates CARE Ratings’ expectation of continued healthy operating performance and sufficient liquidity,
bolstered by the timely execution of the order book, which is expected to further enhance the financial risk profile over the
medium term.
Detailed description of key rating drivers:
Key strengths
Growing scale of operations:
The company has achieved TOI of Rs. 342.65 crore in FY24, marking growth of approximately 14% compared to FY23. The
growth in TOI was primarily driven by higher order book execution. Further, company's PBILDT & profit after tax (PAT) margin
has remained almost stable at ~12% & ~6% respectively during FY24.
The company has achieved TOI of ~Rs. 149 crores with PBILDT margin of ~18% during H1FY25 (refers to the period April 01 to
September 30). The company is prioritizing the execution of slope and tunnel projects in the second half of FY25, as these projects
offer higher profitability margins compared to the highly competitive road construction projects.
CARE Ratings anticipates that the company’s scale of operations will continue to grow in the medium term, driven by an expanding
order book and effective execution.

1 CARE Ratings Ltd.
Press Release
Comfortable financial risk profile:
The company recently went for IPO & got listed in April 2024 which resulted in total inflow of Rs. 130.20 crores. Successful fund
raising using IPO resulted in improvement in the financial risk profile & liquidity position of the company. The overall gearing of
the company improved from 0.71x as on March 31, 2023, to 0.33x as on March 31, 2024, primarily on account of share application
money received during IPO. The interest coverage ratio of the company has improved from 6.60x in FY23 (refers to the period
April 01 to March 31) to 7.36x in FY24 (refers to the period April 01 to March 31) on account of better profitability during FY24.
Total debt to gross cash accruals has (TD/GCA) improved to 1.32x as on March 31, 2024 (PY: 1.63x) owing to increased GCA
level.
The overall gearing of the company has further improved to 0.16x as on September 30, 2024, majorly due to receipt of entire
IPO proceeds during Q1FY25 (refers to the period April 01 to June 30) and consequential improvement in networth position.
Care Ratings’ expects the company to maintain its comfortable financial risk profile over medium term, supported by better order
book execution, healthy profitability and absence of any major debt funded capex.
Healthy order book position; albeit remains geographically concentrated:
The company has an unexecuted order book of ~Rs.1,589 crores as on November 30, 2024, which is equivalent to 4.6 times of
TOI of FY24 thereby providing strong revenue visibility in the medium term and includes orders for roads, bridges, canals, tunnels
and small hydro projects. The current order book of the company is majorly from government and quasi government entities,
where the counterparty risk is low. The order book however remains concentrated with ~66% coming from top 5 projects. The
company majorly operates in Jammu & Kashmir (J&K), Uttarakhand and Ladakh region due to expertise in construction of
roads/bridges/tunnels at higher altitudes. Therefore, the order book has geographical concentration in the state of J&K with
around 43% share followed by Uttarakhand with around 21% share and Ladakh having ~17% share; thus, exposing the company
to geographical concentration risk and any adverse change in government policy and rules & regulations related to construction
activities in these areas may impact company’s performance. Further, the management is focusing on diversifying its order book
towards other states in India mainly, Jharkhand, Orissa etc.
While the company’s order book position remains healthy and ensures strong revenue visibility in the medium term, the addition
of new orders and the timely execution of the existing order book will be crucial factors to monitor for ratings.
Experienced promoters and established track record in construction industry:
SRM was incorporated in year 2008 by Mr. Sanjay Mehta, who has experience of around two decades in executing diverse
construction & Infrastructural projects. The company has a long track record of successfully completing several projects such as
roads, bridges, canals, tunnels and small hydro projects. SRM has executed projects across northern India with contracts executed
in the state of Uttarakhand, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Ladakh etc.
Key weaknesses
Presence in a highly fragmented and competitive construction industry:
SRM is a mid-sized player operating in the intensely competitive construction industry wherein contracts are awarded on the basis
of relevant experience of the bidder, financial capability, and most attractive bid price. The highly competitive intensity is on
account of the presence of a large number of contractors resulting in aggressive bidding which exerts pressure on the margins.
Further, aggressive bidding, interest rate risk and delays in projects due to environmental clearance are other external factors
may affect the credit profile of industry players.
Inherent execution risks related to projects:
The construction projects in residential and commercial segments have an inherent risk of delay in execution due to site hand
over, weather conditions and issues related to availability of labour etc. which may result in time and cost overrun in the projects.
However, the long industry experience of SRM’s promoters of around two decades and the company’s long track record mitigates
these risks to some extent.
Working capital intensive nature of operations though efficiently managed:
The company’s operations are capital-intensive, primarily due to an extended collection period resulting from the inclusion of
retention money in projects. The company’s average collection period & inventory period increased to 61 days & 23 days
respectively, in FY24 as against 54 days & 13 days respectively, in FY23 on account of increased order book position. Creditor’s
period remained stable at 26 days during FY24. The operating cycle elongated albeit remained comfortable at 58 days in FY24 as
against 40 days in FY23. Further, gross current assets days of the company stood at 135 days as on March 31, 2024. The company
meets its working capital requirements largely through working capital bank limits, interest free mobilization advances and
stretching of creditors payment. With envisaged growth in scale of operations and healthy order book position, working capital
2 CARE Ratings Ltd.
Press Release
requirements of the company are expected to increase in medium term. The company’s ability to manage its working capital
requirements with minimal reliance on external debt will remain a key monitorable.
Liquidity: Adequate
Adequate liquidity is marked by sufficient buffer available between expected accruals of ~Rs.53 crores against debt repayment
obligations of ~Rs.9 crores during FY25 (refers to the period April 01 to March 31). The liquidity is further aided by free cash,
bank & FDR balances of ~Rs. 57 crores as on September 30, 2024. Utilization of fund based working capital limit has remained
low at around 40-50% during past 12 months ended November 2024.
The company will be incurring a capex of around Rs. 30 crores mainly for additional equipment and machinery requirement for
efficient execution of orders in hand that would be funded out of IPO proceeds & additional term loan as per requirements.

Details of instruments/facilities in Annexure-1.
Rationale and key rating drivers
Reaffirmation of ratings assigned to bank facilities and fixed deposit programme of Shreyans Industries Limited (SIL) continues
to derive strength from its experienced promoters, long track record of operations, and comfortable liquidity position of the
company. Ratings continue to derive strength from the comfortable solvency position marked by low overall gearing, softening of
input prices leading to improvement in the profit before interest, lease rentals, depreciation, and taxation (PBILDT) margins,
however, moderate total operating income (TOI) due to decline in the volume and net sales realisations (NSR) of Writing &
Printing Paper (W&PP) segment, though the same was offset by its adequate operational cash flows generated over the years,
leading to lower dependence on working capital borrowings. Ratings also continue to derive comfort from well-established
distribution network, diversified product profile, and proximity of the manufacturing plant to raw material sources.
However, ratings continue to remain constrained by competitive nature of the industry and profitability susceptible margins to
raw material price volatility and foreign exchange fluctuations.
Rating sensitivities: Factors likely to lead to rating actions
Positive factors
• Improvement in scale of operations by 20% or more with improvement in PBILDT margin above 15% on a sustained basis.
Negative factors
• Under-achievement of the projected total operating income by more than 25% and/or significant decline in profitability which
may adversely impact the liquidity of the company with decrease in unencumbered mutual fund investments.
• Any major debt-funded capex or high reliance on working capital borrowings resulting in total debt/PBILDT above 1.50x.
Analytical approach:
Standalone
Outlook: Stable
CARE Ratings Limited (CARE Ratings) expects the company to have stable operational performance and shall sustain its strong
financial risk profile over the medium term on back of its strong liquidity profile.
Detailed description of key rating drivers:
Key strengths
Stable operational performance
Softening of input prices has led to improving PBILDT margin in the last few fiscals. The company’s PBILDT margin improved to
14.01% in FY24 (PY: 12.78%) owing to decrease in raw material cost (primarily wheat straw and caustic lye). Earlier in FY23,
due to high input prices, the NSR was high which has currently normalised as a result of softening of input prices. The company’s
profit after tax (PAT) margin improved to 12.50% in FY24 (PY: 8.48%) owing to improvement in PBILDT margin and non-
operating income of ₹34.25 crore (PY: ₹1.56 crore) reported in FY24, which majorly includes gain on fair value of mutual fund
investments amounting to ₹30.07 crore.

Press Release
Despite the overall downturn in the W&PP industry, the company has demonstrated resilience. Although there was a year-on-
year moderation of ~19% in TOI, which stood at ₹699.61 crore in FY24 (compared to ₹865.88 crore in the previous year), the
company managed to maintain stability. The volumes remained almost stagnant in Q1FY25 (refers to April 01, 2024 to June 30,
2024) owing to the planned shut down of the plant for 10 days for modification purposes by the company.
The primary reason for de-growth in sales revenue was the decline in the average NSR, whereby the NSR for W&PP segment
reduced to ₹69,729 per MT in FY24 (PY: ₹80,218 per MT) and volumes reduced to 88,850 MT in FY24 (PY: 93132 MT). In Q1FY25,
the TOI stood low at ₹187.81 crore.
Additionally, the company expects to achieve better volumes going forward owing to the capex projected in near to medium term.
These include the Steam & Condensate system, installation of a Closed hood and pocket ventilation for the paper machine and
replacing the current surface coating machine with an advanced speed sizer. These improvements are expected to enhance
operational quality and overall energy efficiency by reducing steam consumption.
The rebound is expected from FY25 onwards, as the adoption of the New Education policy is likely to boost demand for WPP
segment. Other key demand factors will include a focus on innovative and attractive packaging and the shift from plastic to paper-
based packaging in fast-moving consumer good (FMCG) and food & food product sectors.
Comfortable solvency position
The solvency position remained comfortable with overall gearing ratio of 0.09x as on March 31, 2024 (PY: 0.14x) mainly
considering low reliance on external borrowings as the cash flow from operations stood healthy at ₹77.12 crore in FY24. The debt
coverage indicators of the company remained comfortable as reflected by PBILDT interest coverage of 23.05x (PY: 20.56x) and
total debt to gross cash accruals (TD/GCA) of 0.32x (PY: 0.47x) in FY24 considering low finance cost and improvement in the
GCA of the company.
Experienced promoters with long track record of operations
SIL has been engaged in manufacturing writing and printing paper (WPP) business for over three and a half decades now which
has led to well-established relationship with the suppliers and the customers. Rajneesh Oswal, Chairman, has an overall experience
of over two and a half decades. Vishal Oswal (brother of Rajneesh Oswal), Managing Director, has an overall experience of over
two decades.
Diversified product profile and an established distribution network
SIL manufactures WPP with a grams per square metre (GSM) ranging between 44 GSM and 200 GSM and a brightness range of
75% to 90%. The paper finds its application in printing of books, notebooks, calendars, diaries, newspaper supplements,
pamphlets, computer stationary, playing cards, brochures, magazines and copier paper, and envelope making, among others. It
has one marketing branch in Delhi and a network of around hundred dealers all over India. The company sells to government
clients where orders are procured on tender basis and to private players. The company also exports its products to UAE, Nepal,
and Sri Lanka among others. However, the income derived from this segment remained negligible. The diversified product portfolio
and established distribution network will continue to support the business risk profile over the medium term.
Proximity of manufacturing plants to raw material sources
Raw materials for SIL include primarily agricultural residue based raw materials such as wheat straw, sarkanda, and rice husk,
among others. The plant is in an established agricultural belt, Punjab, leading to easy and ample availability of raw materials.
Key weaknesses
Susceptibility of margins to foreign exchange fluctuations
SIL imports wood pulp from USA, Indonesia and Canada. Imported raw materials formed ~16% of the total raw material cost in
FY24. The proceeds from exports remained at Rs.2.47 crore in FY24 (PY: Rs.4.74 crore). This provides a minimal natural hedge
to a certain extent. Further, the company avails forward contracts from time to time to hedge a portion of the foreign exchange
risk. However, some portion of the exposure still remains unhedged, exposing the profitability of the company to any adverse
fluctuation in the foreign exchange prices. In FY24, the company reported a gain of Rs.0.44 crore on foreign currency transaction
(PY: gain of Rs.0.35 crore).
2 CARE Ratings Ltd.
Press Release
Highly competitive industry and margins susceptible to raw material volatility
The paper industry is highly fragmented in nature with stiff competition from a large number of organised and unorganised players
and threat from imports. This limits the pricing power of the manufacturers in terms of flexibility to pass on the raw material price
fluctuation to its customers. SIL primarily uses agro-based raw material which is purchased from the domestic markets. Their use
is associated with limitations like seasonal availability leading to high volatility in their prices. Therefore, the company’s operating
profitability remains highly susceptible to raw material price volatility.
Liquidity: Adequate
Liquidity position of the company is adequate as reflected by adjusted GCA to the tune of ~₹75.87 crore in FY24 against scheduled
gross loan repayments to the tune of ₹8.84 crore. The average utilisation of working capital borrowings stood at ~20% for the
trailing 12 months ended August 31, 2024. The company has liquid mutual fund investments (quoted at market value) to the
tune of ₹219.86 crore as on March 31, 2024, out of which ₹155.95 crore were unencumbered investments. SIL is expected to
incur capex of ~₹19.00 crore in FY25 pertaining to improvement in quality of WPP manufactured and the same shall be entirely
funded from internal accruals.

Rating Rationale Rating Rationale August 26, 2024 | Mumbai TV Today Network LimitedRatings reaffirmed at 'CRISIL AA/Stable/CRISIL A1+' Rating ActionTotal Bank Loan Facilities RatedRs.100 CroreLong Term RatingCRISIL AA/Stable (Reaffirmed)Short Term RatingCRISIL A1+ (Reaffirmed)Note: None of the Directors on CRISIL Ratings Limited’s Board are members of rating committee and thus do not participate in discussion or assignment of any ratings. The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities Detailed Rationale CRISIL Ratings has reaffirmed its ‘CRISIL AA/Stable/CRISIL A1+’ ratings on the bank facilities of TV Today Network Ltd (TVTN). Operating revenue improved by 8% to Rs 952 crore in fiscal 2024, from Rs 878 crore in fiscal 2023, However, operating profit fell to around Rs 86 crore, from Rs 132 crore over the fiscal 2023. Operating performance was weaker than expected due to investments made in the digital segment. That said, the financial profile continues to remain robust, and the business profile continues to remain healthy. Financial profile is reflected through nil debt and healthy cash and equivalents of Rs 469 crore as on March 31, 2024. Business profile is reflected through market leadership position in Hindi television news and online news (in segments such as YouTube and WhatsApp channels). Driven by ongoing efforts to improve cost margins and market leadership position, it is expected that consolidated operating profit (including spends on digital) is likely to touch Rs 150-160 crore in fiscal 2025. The ratings continue to reflect the established market position of TVTN in the Hindi news segment and its robust financial risk profile because of strong liquidity and negligible debt. These strengths are partially offset by significant dependence on the flagship channel (Aaj Tak) for revenue and modest profitability of other businesses. Analytical Approach To arrive at its ratings, CRISIL Ratings has combined the business and financial risk profiles of TVTN and its subsidiaries, together referred to as TVTN. All the entities are under a common management and have strong business and financial linkages. Please refer Annexure - List of Entities Consolidated, which captures the list of entities considered and their analytical treatment of consolidation. Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description Strengths: Established market position in the Hindi news segment: The company’s flagship news channel, Aaj Tak, which was launched in December 2000, has shown strong competition among Hindi news channels. Aaj Tak has crossed the 65 million subscriber mark on YouTube and retains its position as the world’s most subscribed and watched news channel on YouTube. TVTN’s 31 dedicated digital-first video-channels, with the ‘Tez’ and ‘Tak’ brand names, have a presence across 10 content genres and five languages. The Lallantop is the first digital Hindi news platform with over 28 million subscribers and 3.3 billion views on YouTube. Aaj Tak, along with the digital first operations under the brand ‘Tak’ and ‘The Lallantop’ will continue to support the business risk profile. Robust financial risk profile: Adjusted networth continues to remain strong at Rs 841 crore as on March 31, 2024. The company continues to have nil debt along with robust debt protection metrics. Liquidity stood at ~Rs 469 crore as on March 31, 2024. The financial risk profile will remain healthy in the long term, supported by healthy cash accrual, moderate capital expenditure (capex) and strong liquidity. Weaknesses: Significant dependence on Aaj Tak: TVTN has acquired the digital business of Living Media India Ltd (LMIL) to diversify its revenue base. However, Aaj Tak contributes to a significant portion of revenue and operating profit as other businesses are at early stages. Although digital operations have witnessed healthy growth, the dependence on Aaj Tak will continue over the medium term. Steady revenue growth in other businesses will be a key monitorable. Modest profitability of other businesses: Despite healthy revenue growth and cost rationalisation in other businesses, TV broadcasting (primarily Aaj Tak) continues to be the primary driver of the bottom line. The company’s operating profitability has been impacted due to continued investments in the digital segment. TVTN reported operating profit of Rs 86 crore in fiscal 2024, as opposed to Rs 132 crore in fiscal 2023. That said, improvement of monetization in the digital formats coupled with ongoing efforts for cost rationalization should aid operating profit reaching Rs 150-160 crore in fiscal 2025. Liquidity: Strong Cash and liquid investments stood at Rs 469 crore as on March 31, 2024. Net cash accrual of Rs 100-120 core expected per annum in fiscals 2025 and 2026 against nil debt, will cover capex and working capital requirement over the medium term. Outlook: Stable The business risk profile of TVTN will continue to be supported by the dominant position of Aaj Tak in the Hindi news segment. In the absence of any debt-funded capex, the financial risk profile will remain strong in the long term. Rating sensitivity factors Upward factors Significant revenue growth and sustenance of operating profitability above 30% Increased revenue diversity while maintaining strong financial risk profile Downward factors Decline in revenue due to weakened market position and deteriorating business risk profile such that operating margin sustain below 12% Significant debt-funded capex or investment or any large dividend impacting capital structure About the Company TVTN is promoted by the India Today group. The company broadcasts 24-hour news channels: Aaj Tak, Good News Today and Aaj Tak HD in Hindi, and India Today Television in English. It also runs radio stations (Ishq; 104.8 FM) in Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata. TVTN acquired the digital operations business of LMIL in fiscal 2018. The digital business comprises Aaj Tak and India Today websites, along with various social media and online video channels. About the Group The India Today group, set up in 1975, has diverse business interests, including news channels, radio stations, own publications (India Today and Business Today), publications under licence (Reader's Digest, Cosmopolitan), marketing and distribution of international publications (TIME), and book publishing and printing.

Rating Rationale Rating Rationale October 03, 2024 | Mumbai Control Print LimitedRatings reaffirmed at 'CRISIL A/Stable/CRISIL A1' Rating ActionTotal Bank Loan Facilities RatedRs.80 CroreLong Term RatingCRISIL A/Stable (Reaffirmed)Short Term RatingCRISIL A1 (Reaffirmed)Note: None of the Directors on CRISIL Ratings Limited’s Board are members of rating committee and thus do not participate in discussion or assignment of any ratings. The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities Detailed Rationale CRISIL Ratings has reaffirmed its ratings on the bank loan facilities of Control Print Limited (CPL; part of the Control Print group) at ‘CRISIL A/Stable/CRISIL A1’. In fiscal 2024, on consolidated level topline increased 18.1% year-on-year to Rs 359 crore, driven by increase in sales from consumables. During FY 24 contribution from printers to the overall sales was lower as compared to FY 23 but realization per printer was improved. Consequently, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) increased 13% year-on-year to Rs 87 crore in fiscal 2024 and but EBITDA margin was moderated to 24.23% by 101 basis point mainly on account of expenses incurred towards acquisition of assets. During fiscal 2025, group is expected to register revenue growth with better operating margins. The financial risk profile is supported by healthy net cash accrual of Rs 54 crore in fiscal 2024. This along with reduction in debt resulted in net cash accrual to adjusted debt ratio remained at 36.59 times as on March 31, 2024. Healthy cash accrual resulted in adjusted networth increasing from Rs 271 crore as on March 31, 2023 to Rs 309 crore as on March 31, 2024. As a result, gearing decreased from 0.01 times to “Nil” times for the same period. The company has cash and cash equivalents of Rs 22 crore as on 31st March 2024 adding to the financial flexibility. The ratings continue to reflect the extensive experience of the promoter in the industrial printer industry, CPL’s established market position, healthy profitability and robust financial risk profile. These strengths are partially offset by large working capital requirement and moderate scale of operations. Analytical Approach For arriving at the ratings, CRISIL Ratings has combined the business and financial risk profiles of CPL and its subsidiaries, Liberty Chemicals Pvt Ltd (LCPL), Innovative Codes (I) Private Limited (ICPL), Control Print B.V. (CPBV) and Mark Print B.V. (MPBV),CP Italy SRL., Carton Handling Solutions Ltd , Codeology Group Ltd (UK)and Control Print packaging Pvt Ltd . This is because the promoters are same and there are financial linkages between the group companies. Please refer Annexure - List of Entities Consolidated, which captures the list of entities considered and their analytical treatment of consolidation. Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description Strengths: Well Established market position backed by extensive experience of the promoter: The group’s brand, Control Print, has a strong recall in the domestic industrial printer market as the promoter has over 32 years’ experience in the segment. It also has established relationships with reputed clientele such as Hindustan Unilever Ltd, Britannia Industries Ltd, Tata Steel Ltd, ITC, United Brewries, Aristo Pharma etc. Compony is one of the largest players in India in Coding and Marking industry with market share of more than 18%. Sound operating efficiencies: Company has healthy operating efficiencies marked by healthy return on capital employed of ~21-25% in the past three fiscals through fiscal 2024. The company has been able to register operating margins in the range of 19-26% over the past five fiscals through fiscal 2024, with continuous improvement in technologies and improved scale of operations. Company is expected to maintain healthy RoCE over medium term, backed by healthy profitability. Strong financial risk profile: Networth and total outside liabilities to adjusted networth ratio are healthy at Rs 309 crore and 0.3 time, respectively, as on March 31, 2024. Debt protection metrices were robust on account of strong operating profitability and low utilization of debt. Financial risk profile is expected to remain strong with healthy accretion of reserves, with no debt funded capex expected over medium term. Weaknesses: Moderate but improving scale of operations: CPL has moderate scale of operations as indicated by turnover of Rs 256-359 crore in the past three fiscals through fiscal 2024. The Indian industrial printer market is dominated by Videojet India Pvt Ltd, Domino Printech India Pvt Ltd, Markem-Imaje India Pvt Ltd and CPL. Multinational companies (MNCs) have carved a market for themselves being in the industry for a longer period and have established their position in the organised market Furthermore, being global players, MNCs have larger installed base to garner higher revenues. However, CPL is continuously improving its product mix and is expected to improve its market share with higher installed printer base over medium term. However, CRISIL Ratings believes that the moderate scale of operations and intense competition from MNCs will continue to constrain the business risk profile of CPL over the medium term. Working capital intensive operations: CPL’s operations are working capital intensive as indicated by high gross current assets of 232 days as of March 2024. This is primarily on account of high inventory level of around 123 days, maintained to ensure timely supply of consumable and spare parts to clientele. Operations are expected to remain working capital intensive over the medium term, and may continue to be funded by internal accrual, minimising bank limit utilisation. Liquidity: Strong Bank limit utilisation is low at around 23 percent for the past twelve months ended August 2024. Cash accrual are expected to be over Rs 55 crore. Liquid investments of around Rs.22 crore in shares, debentures, and mutual funds as on March 31, 2024. Low gearing and moderate net worth support its financial flexibility, and provides the financial cushion available in case of any adverse conditions or downturn in the business Outlook: Stable CRISIL Ratings believes CPL's business and financial risk profile will benefit from its established market position, already established printer base and new product launches. Rating sensitivity factors Upward factors: Significant gain in market share and improvement in revenue above 30% and profitability with operating margins remaining above 25%. Improvement in working capital cycle with sustained financial risk profile Downward factors: Sustained decline in revenue and subdued profitability weakening net cash accruals to below Rs 25 crore Stretch in working capital cycle or large debt funded capex or sustained material decline ROCE weakens the financial risk profile About the Group Set up 1991 in Mumbai by Mr Basant Kabra, CPL manufactures industrial printers and consumables such as ink and spares, and also provides maintenance services. The company is listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange. While sale of printers contributes 20-25% of total revenue, income from consumables and servicing account for the remaining 75-80%.

Ltd (GDHPL), GR Dwarka Devariya Highway Private Limited (GDDHPL). All the assets acquired are road assets under the hybrid annuity mode (HAM). Post the acquisition of stake by IIT, the existing debt at the SPVs were repaid through facility 1 of the RTL raised at the InvIT level. Furthermore, two SPVs - VSEPL and GPEL – had exposure in form of NCDs at the SPV level, have been refinanced through facility 2 of the RTL raised at InvIT level. In Q2FY25 and Q4FY25, IIT acquired two more SPVs namely, GR Aligarh Kanpur Highway Private Limited (GRAKHPL), GR Galgalia Bahadurganj Highway Private Limited respectively (GGBHPL). Ind-Ra has taken a consolidated cash flow approach of the project SPVs under the InVIT. Post the acquisition of GGBHPL, IIT had refinanced the debt at the SPV level through the debt raised at the InvIT level.  At present, all the nine SPVs individually do not have any external debt. The entire external debt is at the InvIT level, providing full cash-flow fungibility within the InvIT. Detailed Rationale of the Rating Action The rating continues to be supported by the robust pool of operating assets with a low revenue risk profile in the form of stable cash flows from the strong counterparty National Highways Authority of India (NHAI, ‘IND AAA’/Stable), the inherent features of HAM  projects, the established track record of timely receipt of 59 annuities until March 2025 across nine special purpose vehicles (SPVs), minimal residual construction risk, comfortable coverage ratios and high cash flow fungibility. The rating is further supported by the presence of adequate liquidity. The rating assigned is not a comment on the ability of IIT to meet the distribution/dividend payouts to unitholders/investors. List of Key Rating Drivers Strengths Robust pool of operating assets, with low revenue risk profile Minimal completion risk Low O&M risk Moderate debt structure Asset acquisition strategy Weaknesses Future acquisitions with large debt could impact coverages Detailed Description of Key Rating Drivers Robust Pool of Operating Assets, with Low Revenue Risk Profile: The rating reflects the timely receipt of 59 semi-annual annuities from the NHAI, without any material deductions, post the achievement of provisional commercial operations date (PCOD) across nine operational SPVs. The HAM assets are located in the states of Punjab, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. These roads are operated and maintained as per the concession rights granted by NHAI and are owned and operated by the SPVs. The HAM assets post achievement of PCOD have three revenue streams: i) 60% of the price index multiple (PIM)-adjusted bid project cost spread across 15 years, in the form of 30 biannual instalments; ii) interest on the balance annuities outstanding; and iii) O&M bid quote adjusted by PIM-linked inflation. The interest on the balance annuity is linked to the Reserve Bank of India’s bank rate plus 300bp for eight assets (PDEPL, VSEPL, GGSHPL, GASHPL, GPEL, GDHPL, GDDHPL and GRAKHPL) and the average of one-year of MCLR of the top five scheduled commercial banks plus 125bp for the remaining one asset (GGBHPL). The PIM comprises 70% wholesale price index and 30% consumer price index. The management gets refund of the standard tax deducted at source on the annuity for the respective accounting years based on the accounted income. This stable stream of revenue from the strong counterparty, NHAI, mitigates the revenue risk.The forthcoming annuity payments could fall short due to deductions for non-conformance to maintenance requirements during the concession term. However, the satisfactory operating track record of GR Infraprojects Limited (GRIL, with which the project manager of the InvIT, has an O&M sub-contract) in the highways sector and the low complexity of the O&M for HAM-based road projects lend strength to the rating. Minimal Completion Risk: The InvIT had acquired an initial portfolio of seven HAM projects, which have achieved PCOD/COD. GPEL, PDEPL, GDHPL, GASHPL VSEPL and GSSHPL achieved final COD on 26 May 2021, 13 October 2021, 30 September 2022 and 9 March 2023, 19 January 2022 and 1 March 2023, respectively. GRAKHPL, which was acquired during September 2024, had achieved the final COD on 9 August 2024. GDDHPL and GGBHPL are yet to receive the final COD. As per the management, there is no residual construction work in projects that is yet to achieve final COD. InvIT as part of its strategy plans to acquire operational assets with minimal residual construction risk. Low O&M Risk:  The project SPVs have entered into respective fixed price operation and maintenance (O&M) contracts with the project manager of the InvIT, namely Aadharshila Infratech Private Limited (AIPL). AIPL has entered into a back-to-back fixed-price O&M sub-contracts with GRIL, which has strong executional and operational capabilities in developing and operating multiple HAM-based road projects. The contracts are for the entire duration of the concession agreement in line with the cost provided in technical due diligence study.The project stretches of PDEPL, GASHPL, GSSHPL, GDDHPPL, GRAKHPL are completely rigid, wherein the requirement of periodic maintenance/overlay would be minimal. VESPL and GGBHPL consists sections of both rigid and flexible pavements, while the projects of GDHPL and GPEL consist of completely flexible stretches. Ind-Ra, in its base case, has considered contracted O&M costs for the coming years and these are broadly comparable with those of Ind-Ra-rated peers. Moderate Debt Structure:  IIT availed debt of INR11,496.7 million to refinance the SPV-level debt in the initial tranche of seven assets. The RTL is to be amortised over a period of 51 quarters ending on 30 September 2036. The InvIT availed debt of INR6,820 to refinance the debt at SPV level of GRAKHPL asset. The debt is to be amortised over 26 semi-annual instalments ending on 31 March 2037. Furthermore, the InvIT has obtained a sanction of INR5,850 million to refinance the debt at GGBHPL and the refinancing of the secured debt was completed on 8 May 2025. Furthermore, the management has stated that InvIT proposes to avail an additional external debt of about INR5833 million for refinancing of debt in assets to be acquired. Accordingly, the agency has considered an aggregate external debt of INR30.00 billion for the InvIT while computing the coverages. The terms of the external debt for funding the acquisition of proposed SPVs are yet to be finalised, and hence, the InvIT has provided an indicative repayment schedule that has been considered by the agency for computing the coverages. The interest rate on all RTLs is linked to the external benchmark rate, namely repo rate. The debt structure stipulates a debt service reserve of one quarter and a minimum debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.10x.  If in any quarter, the DSCR falls below 1.10x, the entire surplus will be trapped in the InvIT. Any increase in the debt affecting the coverage metrics will be a credit negative.Asset Acquisition Strategy: GR Highways Investment Manager Private Limited, the investment manager, will assess the potential acquisitions and propose the same for the decision of the unit holders and as per SEBI InvIT Regulations. The management, during the discussion with the agency, represented that there would be no change in the investment strategy. The InvIT would be looking for the acquisition of other NHAI HAM projects from GRIL, with whom InvIT has a right of first offer, as well as other outside road asset developers. The InvIT could also acquire HAM assets/projects that have achieved PCOD but are yet to complete one year of operations to the maximum extent of 10% of the enterprise value of InvIT. Future Acquisitions with Large Debt Could Impact Coverages: Although the SEBI’s InvIT regulations allow the acquisition of under-construction assets, the investment manager intends to acquire only operational assets that would be value-accretive to its investors, and annuity projects from strong counterparties (preferably the NHAI). The investment manager will not have any business interest other than managing business activities for the InvIT. The investment management fees will be capped at 1.50% of the aggregate cash flows of the InvIT. The agency will evaluate all the future acquisitions with large debt that could impact the coverages significantly; this will be a key monitoring event for a rating review. Liquidity Adequate: Ind-Ra expects IIT to generate surplus cash flows annually, given the strong availability-based cash flows and comfortable level of average DSCR over the debt tenor, considering the aggregate debt of about INR30 billion and InvIT cashflows. These coverages are resilient to the stress applied on interest costs and operating costs. The projects under the InvIT are exposed to performance-related annuity deductions; however, the presence of HAM projects minimises the risk. Ind-Ra derives sufficient comfort from the strong credit profile and robust operational history of the O&M sub-contractor. Any material delay or deductions in forthcoming annuities from the NHAI would be a key monitorable. Rating Sensitivities Positive: Not applicable Negative: Future developments that could, individually or collectively, lead to a negative rating action are: significant delays or deductions in annuities, resulting in the weakening of average coverage from Ind-Ra’s base case assumptions below 1.30x deterioration in the credit profile of NHAI and/or the project manager a decline in the DSCR due to the acquisition of weaker asset, any adverse funding pattern, orany adverse regulatory changes any significant deterioration in the credit profile of the O&M sub-contractor and/or a dismal operational performance of the project manager that could result in any adverse remarks on the overall road quality of the project asset by the independent engineer or the NHAI Any Other Information Minimal Impact of GST:  The goods and services tax (GST) is applicable on all the three revenue components - annuity, interest on annuity and O&M. The SPVs have been receiving the GST component on interest on annuity and GST Change in law impact payments for GASHPL, VSEPL, GSSHPL and GPEL. The GST payable on annuities are typically offset against the GST input tax credit available to the company; the net cash outflow post the exhaustion of input tax credit (typically last three-to-four years of operational period) would be reimbursed by the NHAI as per the policy circular dated 1 September 2021, thus leading to minimal cash flow impact on the project. About the Company IIT, which received registration under SEBI’s InvIT regulations in August 2022, has a portfolio of nine HAM road assets. IIT raised funds through a public offer to acquire equity and partially refinance the debt in the seven SPVs (tranche 1 assets). AIPL, the sponsor of IIT, has 15% unitholding in IIT.

Details of instruments/facilities in Annexure-1.
Rationale and key rating drivers
The rating reaffirmation of long-term instruments and issuer rating of Ashiana Housing Limited (AHL) continues to derive strength
from extensive experience of promoters of nearly four decades in the real estate industry marked by a track record of real estate
development of over 300 lakh square-feet (lsf) of commercial and residential space. Ratings also favourably take into cognisance,
healthy booking status in the overall project portfolio at an intermediate stage of construction, leading to build up of substantial
committed receivables, ensuring robust cash flow visibility in ongoing projects. The rating of AHL also draws comfort from strong
financial risk profile characterised by low debt levels and strong liquidity position. Healthy sales traction in early to intermediate
stages of projects enables the company in managing substantial construction funding through customer advances. With a low
debt profile, AHL continues to maintain robust gearing levels and strong debt to collection ratio.
CARE Ratings Limited (CARE Ratings) also takes note of strong growth in sales and collections of the company in FY24 and
H1FY25, primarily driven by successfully launching new projects and achieving healthy sales in these newly launched
developments. In total, the company launched over 10 new projects (including new phases of existing projects) in FY24 and
9MFY25, covering a saleable area of over 25 lakh square feet. As of September 30, 2024, the company achieved over 65% of
average sales in these projects. Consequently, bookings grew by over 30% year on year (y-o-y) in FY24 and over 15% y-o-y in
H1FY25. Similarly, collections also increased by over 60% y-o-y in FY24 and over 20% y-o-y in H1FY25.
However, rating strengths are tempered by execution risk associated with ongoing and upcoming projects with high reliance on
customer advances for funding the future project costs, moderate saleability risk in projects in tier-II cities, moderate scale of
operations, and inherent cyclicality associated with real estate sector.
Rating sensitivities: Factors likely to lead to rating actions
Positive factors
• Sustained growth in overall sales and collections of the company and maintenance of comfortable leverage profile.
Negative factors
• Significant delay in execution of the project, leading to delay in billing and realisation of collections.
• Considerable decline in the percentage of committed receivable to cover balance project cost and outstanding debt to 60%
and below, on a sustained basis.
Analytical approach: Consolidated.
CARE Ratings has considered the consolidated business and financial risk profile of AHL and its subsidiaries, as these entities are
linked through a parent-subsidiary relationship and have common management, operational & financial linkage. Companies
consolidated is listed under Annexure-6.

Press Release Press Release
Outlook: Stable
The “Stable” outlook reflects CARE Ratings’ belief that the entity is likely to sustain its sales and collection momentum from the
ongoing projects, while maintaining comfortable financial risk profile.
Detailed description of key rating drivers:
Key strengths
Experienced promoters with project execution capabilities
AHL is managed by, Mr. Vishal Gupta, (Managing Director), Mr Ankur Gupta (Joint Managing Director) and Mr Varun Gupta (Whole
time Director), who are professionally qualified and have vast experience in construction, real estate and finance. AHL has
extensive experience of nearly four decades in the real estate industry. As on March 31, 2024, the company constructed
cumulatively over 300 lsf of residential and commercial space in Jaipur, Bhiwadi, Jodhpur, Jamshedpur, Neemrana, Gurugram,
Pune and Chennai, which reflects strong project execution capabilities. The company primarily focuses on senior living, premium
homes and Kid-Centric Homes. As on September 30, 2024, there are 32 ongoing projects portfolio with total area of ~75 lsf.
Comfortable financial risk profile and strong liquidity position
The company’s liquidity position is strong, with healthy liquid balances of ₹305 crore (at consolidated level) as on September 30,
2024, compared to total outstanding debt of ₹270 crore. The debt includes non-convertible debentures (NCDs) of ~₹115 crore,
having long maturity of 20 years and flexibility to pay interest when projects generate distributable surplus. These NCDs are
subscribed by International Financial Corporation (IFC) for its investment in projects having returns linked with project specific
returns. AHL has committed receivables amounting to ₹2,055 crore from ongoing projects, which comfortably cover over 100%
of the remaining project cost and outstanding debt, as on September 30, 2024. With substantial committed receivables, the
company’s cash flow operations are expected to remain strong to meets its upcoming debt obligations. However, significant
cancellations adversely impacting committed receivable position will remain monitorable. AHL’s comfortable debt position is also
reflected from low gearing, which stood below 0.30x as at the end of past three financial years (FY22-FY24). Ratio of gross debt
to collection has also remained comfortable below 0.30x in the previous three fiscals.
Comfortable operational efficiency
The company’s operational performance stood strong marked by healthy growth in bookings and collections in FY24 and H1FY25.
In FY24, bookings grew significantly by 37% y-o-y ₹1,798 crore and collection by 62% y-o-y ₹1,062 crore in FY24, while it grew
by 19% y-o-y and 26% y-o-y in H1FY25, respectively. Growth is majorly attributable to successful launching of new projects. In
FY24 and H1FY25, over 10 projects were launched covering total saleable area of over 25 lsf. As on September 30, 2024, the
company has achieved average sales of over 65% in these projects, driven by strong sales in Amarah Project in Gurugram (85%
booked collective for Phase 2, 3, and 4) and Malhar Project (61% booked) in Pune.
Going ahead, the company is expected to continue witnessing healthy sales momentum in Q4FY25 and H1FY26, given the
expectations of healthy sales from upcoming projects in Gurgaon, where it has established track record of swiftly selling earlier
phases. Healthy improvement in bookings in FY25 is likely to lead to healthy collections in the upcoming years and drive the
company’s cash flow position. As on September 30, 2024, the company has unsold inventory of close to ₹1,290 crore among
ongoing projects and based on sales momentum in the last eight quarters ended September 30, 2024, unsold inventory remains
low at close to three quarters, reflecting the company’s strong sales momentum.
Key weaknesses
Moderate saleability risk in Tier-II cities
As of September 30, 2024, AHL is developing 32 projects, including phases of ongoing developments, having total saleable area
of ~75 lsf. The company is active in eight locations, primarily in Jaipur, Bhiwadi, Jodhpur, Jamshedpur, Neemrana, Gurugram,
Pune, and Chennai. Of the total saleable area, ~40 lsf (53%) is in Tier-I cities (Gurgaon, Pune and Chennai), while the remaining
area is situated in Tier-II cities.
In terms of bookings, ~55% of the total area in Tier-I cities has already been booked, despite substantial area was launched in
FY24 and H1FY25. In contrast, 45% of the total area in Tier-II cities has been booked as on September 30, 2024, indicating
relatively moderate saleability risk in these regions. While the company has diversified project portfolio, it remains exposed to
regulatory or local compliance challenges in multiple regions. The group’s strong presence and established track record of
development in these cities provides adequate comfort.
Project execution risk associated with ongoing and upcoming projects
As on September 30, 2024, the company is currently executing projects with total saleable area of 75 lsf and it has plans to
further undertake development of over 50 lsf in medium term. The overall size of ongoing and upcoming development remains
significant. For the ongoing project portfolio, the company has incurred ~47% of the total estimated project cost of over ₹3,000
crore, which reflects intermediate stage of execution and moderate execution risk for ongoing projects. The balance cost is
expected to be largely funded through customer advances, given the availability of sizeable, committed receivables. For upcoming
projects, the funding strategy is expected to remain same, with low dependence on debt and major reliance on customer
advances. Accordingly, AHL’s ability to achieve healthy bookings in the new projects in early to intermediate stages, in line with
its track record, will remain monitorable.

Press Release Press Release
Inherent cyclical nature of the real estate industry
The company is exposed to the cyclicality associated with the real estate sector which has direct linkage with the general
macroeconomic scenario, interest rates and level of disposable income available with individuals. In case of real estate companies,
profitability highly depends on property markets. A high-interest rate scenario could further discourage consumers from borrowing
to finance real estate purchases and may depress the real estate market. AHL’s portfolio is spread across tier-I and tier-II cities
and although there is stable demand currently, adverse impact in these micro-markets will remain monitorable.
Liquidity: Strong
The company has liquid investments of ₹305 crore (at consolidated level) as on September 30, 2024. The company has committed
receivables of over ₹2,055 crore, which well-covers balance project cost of over ₹1,600 crore and outstanding debt. Given the
strong committed receivables position, the company’s cash flow from operations is expected to remain comfortable to meet its
debt obligations in upcoming years.
Assumptions/Covenants: Not applicable
Environment, social, and governance (ESG) risks:
CARE Ratings believes that AHL’s environment, social, and governance (ESG) profile supports its credit risk profile. Activities in
the real estate sector have an adverse impact on environmental and social aspects, considering high emission levels, waste
generation, climate change, high labour intensity, and related safety issues. The Ashiana group has ongoing focus on managing
its environmental and social risks. Key highlights of ESG initiatives are as below:
• The company is designing and upgrading environment friendly buildings. AHL and its contractors endeavour to provide safe
and healthy working environment to workers at construction sites, including training to improve capabilities of the local
work force. The company also conducts monthly and quarterly safety audits.
• The company uses measures to reduce waste of resources and conservation of technology, which includes solar generators,
rainwater harvesting pit, organic waste converters, DWC pipe and recycling wastewater for flushing and horticulture among
others.
• There was no incident of anti-competitive behaviour in FY24.

Rating Rationale × Info! Info Alert × Success! Success Alert × Warning! Warning Alert × Error! Error Alert RATING RATIONALE 12Jun2024 Texmo Pipes & Products Ltd. Brickwork Ratings downgrades the ratings for the Bank Loan Facilities of Rs. 122.20 Crs. of Texmo Pipes & Products Ltd. based on best available information, as the issuer did not cooperate.

RATING ACTION / OUTLOOK / NATURE OF NON-COOPERATION Brickwork Ratings (BWR) has consistently taken up with Texmo Pipes & Products Ltd. (TPPL or the comapny) through emails and telephone calls to provide the requisite information for the periodic rating surveillance. Despite the best efforts of BWR to get at least the minimum required information for a review, the company continues to remain non-cooperative. Further, the company is not submitting the monthly No Default Statement (NDS) in deviation from the extant guidelines. Due to the continued lack of management cooperation and the absence of adequate information from the firm, BWR is unable to assess the company's operational and financial performance, its ability to service its debt, and maintain a valid rating. Hence, based on the best available information, continued lack of management cooperation, non-submission of monthly NDS and in terms of extant regulatory requirements, BWR has reaffirmed the ratings to BWR BB+/Stable/A4+ and continued it in the ISSUER NOT COOPERATING* category. The lenders/investors may note to exercise due caution while using the above rating which mentions "ISSUER NOT COOPERATING" since the rating lacks any projections or forward-looking component as it is arrived at based on the best available information without any management/banker's interaction. *Issuer did not cooperate; based on best available information LIMITATIONS OF THE RATING Information availability risk is a key factor in the assessment of credit risk as generally non-cooperation by the rated entities to provide required information for a review of the assigned rating may also be accompanied by financial stress. Users of the credit rating should therefore take into account the possible deterioration in the credit quality of the rated entity arising from its non-transparency and withholding of information required for a review of the rating. ANALYTICAL APPROACH - Consolidated BWR has relied upon the consolidated financials of Texmo Pipes & Products Ltd. and publicly available information to arrive at its ratings. BWR has applied its rating methodology as detailed in the Rating Criteria as per the hyperlinks.

Non cooperation by Issuer CRISIL Ratings has been consistently following up with Madhav Copper Limited (MCL) for obtaining information through letter and emails dated June 11, 2024 among others, apart from telephonic communication. However, the issuer has remained non cooperative and the ratings on bank facilities of MCL continues to be ‘CRISIL B-/Stable Issuer Not Cooperating’. Earlier, the entity did not provide the No Default Statements (NDS) for the three consecutive months. Therefore, the issuer was classified as 'non cooperative' in line with Clause 11. 3 of SEBI CRA Operational Circular dated May 16, 2024. ‘The investors, lenders and all other market participants should exercise due caution with reference to the rating assigned/reviewed with the suffix 'ISSUER NOT COOPERATING' as the rating is arrived at without any management interaction and is based on best available or limited or dated information on the company. Such non co-operation by a rated entity may be a result of deterioration in its credit risk profile. These ratings with 'ISSUER NOT COOPERATING' suffix lack a forward looking component.’ Detailed Rationale Despite repeated attempts to engage with the management, CRISIL Ratings failed to receive any information on either the financial performance or strategic intent of MCL, which restricts CRISIL Ratings’ ability to take a forward looking view on the entity's credit quality. CRISIL Ratings believes that rating action on MCL is consistent with ‘Assessing Information Adequacy Risk’. Based on the last available information, the ratings on bank facilities of MCL continues to be ‘CRISIL B-/Stable Issuer Not Cooperating’. About the Company MCL was set up as a private limited company in 2012 and reconstituted as a public limited company in 2017. Promoted by Mr Nilesh N Patel, Mr Rohit B Chauhan, and Ms Divya A Monapara, Bhavnagar (Gujarat)-based MCL manufactures and trades in enameled and submersible wires. It is a part of the Madhav group.

Long Term Bank Facilities 40.00 CARE BBB+; Stable Reaffirmed

(Enhanced from 60.00)
Details of instruments/facilities in Annexure-1.
Rationale and key rating drivers
The reaffirmation of the ratings assigned to the bank facilities of AGI Infra Limited (AGI) derives strength from experienced
promoters with long track record of operations in the real estate sector, regulatory approvals in place, low reliance on debt for
with financial closure already been achieved for the ongoing projects, satisfactory sales velocity resulting in moderate inventory
hangover period and comfortable capital structure with satisfactory cash coverage ratio.
The rating, is however; constrained by moderate saleability risk with high reliance on customer advances, risk of geographical
concentration and susceptibility of the real estate market to economic cycles.
Rating sensitivities: Factors likely to lead to rating actions
Positive factors
• Timely and successful completion of the on-going projects and achievement of collection above Rs.350 crore in the next 12
months.
• Inventory hangover (no of months required to sell unsold inventory given trailing 12 months average sales trend) to remain
at or below 18 months on continued basis
Negative factors
• Substantial delay in collection of committed receivables leading to further availment of debt.
• Significant time and cost overrun leading to reduction in profitability of the project.
Analytical approach:
Standalone
Outlook: Stable
The 'Stable' outlook indicates that the company is expected to remain stable given satisfactory sales velocity and collection
levels coupled with low reliance on debt
Detailed description of the key rating drivers:
Key strengths
Experienced promoters with long track record of operations in the real estate sector
The promoters of the company have been engaged in developing residential and commercial projects for around two decades
and have developed around 87.34 lsf of real estate space over the years. The company has a strong developmental track record
and brand recognition in the Jalandhar real estate market since 2005. The developer has undertaken projects mainly in the
residential segment and only a few projects in the commercial segments.
Regulatory approvals in place for the on-going projects
All necessary regulatory approvals for the ongoing projects are in place. Land has already been acquired and building permit has
been obtained for all the on-going projects. The company has received all the approvals from the appropriate authority(s) which
includes height clearance, water, electricity, fire & emergency, environmental clearance, etc. All projects have been registered
under Punjab Real Estate Regulation Act.

Press Release
Low reliance on debt for the ongoing projects with financial closure already been achieved
The company is currently developing five residential projects with a total cost of Rs 1182 crore. The funding is structured with Rs
85 crore in debt (7% of the project cost), Rs 141 crore from promoter contributions (12% of the project cost), and Rs 957 crore
from customer advances (81% of the project cost). As of December 31, 2024, three projects (Jalandhar Heights-3, Smart Homes-
II, and Sky Villas) have been financed with Rs 85 crore in bank funding. The company has secured financial closure for the entire
debt portion and has disbursed Rs 58 crore for these three projects by December 2024.
Moderate collection momentum of its completed projects
The company has been able to complete 3 projects in the past 12 months namely “JH-2 Phase-3 ” , “Urbana” and “Maxima-
2(M2)”. On a consolidated basis, the company has sold inventory worth approximately Rs 415 crore and collected around Rs 393
crore, representing about 95% of the total from its completed projects as of December 31, 2024. Nearly all the inventory has
been sold, with only 10% of the unsold inventory remaining from the completed projects.
Comfortable capital structure with satisfactory cash coverage ratio
The overall gearing stood comfortable at 0.61x as on March 31, 2024 (0.28x as on March 31, 2023) on the back of limited reliance
on term debt for funding the projects. Out of the five ongoing projects, the company has availed debt for only three: AGI Smart
Homes II (Rs 25 crore), AGI Sky Villa (Rs 40 crore), and Jalandhar Heights-3 (Rs 20 crore).
The average cash coverage ratio for the entire tenure of debt repayment for ongoing and upcoming projects, where a Fixed
Deposit of Rs 78 crore is proposed, remains satisfactory at above 4x. The company plans to raise unsecured fixed deposits of Rs
78 crore by September 2025, with tenures ranging from one to three years, to fund upcoming projects. As articulated by the
management, these fixed deposits will be subscribed by individual investors, with 20% of the amount kept as a bank deposit
equivalent to the amount likely to mature within the next 12 months.
Key weaknesses
Moderate saleability risk with high reliance on customer advance albeit satisfactory sales velocity resulting in
moderate inventory hangover period
Out of a total saleable area of 66.79 lakh square feet, the company has sold approximately 41.37 lakh square feet (62% of the
total saleable area) by December 31, 2024, for a sale consideration of Rs 1137 crore. Of this amount, Rs 450 crore has been
received by December 2024. The committed customer receivables of Rs 687 crore cover around 85% of the outstanding debt of
Rs 85 crore and the pending cost of Rs 721 crore as of December 2024. Also out of total units of 3289, the company has been
able to sell 2355 units till Dec 31, 2024.
In the last nine months ending December 2024, the company collected Rs 182 crore (compared to Rs 130 crore in the previous
year), reflecting average monthly collections of Rs 20 crore. With 81% of the project cost being financed through customer
advances, the project is exposed to risks such as liquidity issues, project delays, and cost overruns. However, the company's sales
velocity remains satisfactory, with 36.17 lakh square feet sold from ongoing projects (16.59 lakh square feet sold as of September
30, 2023) and an additional 5.2 lakh square feet sold from the newly launched project "JH-3 Ext." This helps mitigate some of
the concerns mentioned above. Consequently, the months to sell the remaining inventory stand at a moderate 24 months,
compared to the balance construction period ranging from 12 to 48 months.
Project execution risk for ongoing projects
As of December 31, 2024, the company is executing five residential projects. At an aggregate level, approximately 60% of the
total cost, or Rs 721 crore, is yet to be incurred. Currently, "Sky Villas" is the major ongoing project, with around 30% of the
construction work completed. Given the moderate stage of project construction, there is an impending construction risk, along
with the regular funding required for the construction. The project is expected to be completed by December 2027.
Although the debt required to finance the project has been secured, the company will significantly rely on customer advances
and healthy front-loaded collections to execute the ongoing project. In the past 15 months ended Dec 2024, the company has
received collections of Rs. 126 crore reflecting satisfactory collection momentum from this project.
With a significant portion of the project cost yet to be incurred, the projects remain exposed to execution and off-take risks.
However, the execution risk can be mitigated to some extent, with around 66% coverage of the committed receivables available
to cover the balance project cost and outstanding debt as of December 2024.

Press Release
Risk associated with real estate industry being subject to regulations and competition from other players
Real estate sector demand is linked to the overall economic prospect of the country. Change in the economic outlook affects the
expected cash inflows to a household, thereby also influencing their buying decision. Besides, as leverage forms an important
part of funding for the buyer, availability of loan and interest rates also affects the demand of real estate properties. On the other
hand, land, labour, cement and metal prices being some of major cost centres for the sector, availability of these factors plays
important role in pricing and supply of new units. Hence, cyclicality associated with economic outlook, interest rates, metal prices,
etc., also renders the real estate sector towards cyclicality. Moreover, the companies in the sector are also exposed to regulatory
changes, especially in the countries such as India with evolving regulations. Also, there exists competition from up-coming and
completed projects of other well-known developers in the region.
Risk of geographical concentration
Out of the total area being constructed, the majority of area is being constructed in Jalandhar, which exposes the group to risk
of geographical concentration. However, the company has established its presence in this region and has experienced significant
growth in recent years, thereby mitigating this risk to some extent. Further, in the last few years, there has been moderate growth
in real estate sector of Punjab with large number of local as well as national level real estate players entering with various projects
in the city.
Liquidity: Adequate
The company’s liquidity position is adequate as reflected by consistent customer collection, sales momentum along with cash
balance and liquid investments of Rs. 89.30 cr as on March 31, 2024.
The company has sufficient cushion available for meeting its low debt obligations as the debt repayments in FY26 for the company
amounted to ~Rs.27.03 crore (Interest and Principal). Further, the confirmed receivables of Rs 687 crore cover around 85% of
the total project cost and outstanding debt as of December 2024, likely supporting the company in meeting the remaining project
expenses.
As of December 31, 2024, the company has an unencumbered cash balance and liquid investments of Rs 43 crore. In the last 9
months ended Dec 2024, the company has been able to garner collections of Rs.182 crore (PY: Rs. 130 crore) reflecting average
monthly collections of Rs. 20 crore.

Detailed Rationale
The upgrade (assigned for new bank facilities) in the ratings assigned to the bank facilities of
Silver Touch Technologies Limited (STTL) considers sustained growth in the business
performance of the company with improvement in profitability and cash accruals, satisfactory
capital structure with comfortable debt protection metrics and satisfactory order book position
indicating healthy revenue visibility. Further the aforesaid ratings also continue to derive
comfort from its long track record of promoters, association with reputed clientele resulting in
low counter party risk and locational advantage. However, these rating strengths remain
constrained due to its exposure to intense competition, exposure to technology obsolescence
risk and working capital-intensive nature of its operations. The outlook is expected to remain
1
stable on account of healthy orderbook of the company indicating revenue visibility for the
near to medium term.
Key Rating Sensitivities:
Upward Factors
• Significant growth in scale of business with improvement in profitability metrics thereby
leading to overall improvement in cash accruals
• Sustenance of the capital structure with improvement in debt protection metrics
Downward Factors
• More than expected dip in operating income and/ or moderation in profitability
impacting the debt coverage indicators
• Moderation in overall gearing to more than 1.5x and/or moderation in debt protection
metrics
• Elongation in receivable period and/or increase in working capital intensity impacting
the liquidity
List of Key Rating Drivers with Detailed Description
Key Rating Strengths
• Long track record under experienced and qualified promoters
The promoters have vast experience in information technology domain. Mr. Vipul H.
Thakkar, is the founder director of the company and a technocrat, having experience over
two decades in the IT industry. The other directors are also highly qualified and having
vast experience in IT and business operation. This apart, there is a group of experienced
and adequately qualified personnel in various position of the company.
• Reputed clientele resulting in low counter party risk
Since inception, the company is engaged in providing Information Technology related
services to various State Government, Central Government agencies and private
organisations throughout the country. The company is empanelled service provider of
National Information Centre, RITES, RAILTEL, STPI, BSNL, Industrial Extension Bureau,
Gujarat Informatics Limited etc. This apart, the company also provides IT services to
various big domestic private players engaged in banking, manufacturing and trading
segments.
• Satisfactory order book position indicating healthy revenue visibility
2
The company has an order book amounting to Rs.521.34 Crore as on June 30,2024 of
which Rs.206.46 crore is expected to be realized in FY24-25 (FY refers to the period from
April 1 to March 31) indicating revenue visibility in the near future.
• Locational advantage
The head office of the company is at Ahmedabad. This apart, the company has its branch
and support offices in the cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Lucknow, Baroda, Surat, Kolkata and
Bangalore. All the locations are major cities in India and have adequate education facilities
for higher studies, which ensure regular supply of skilled manpower for IT industry. This
apart, the locations are well connected by air and road and having other required facilities
for IT industry.
• Sustained growth in business performance
The total operating income of the company witnessed a y-o-y growth of ~36% i.e. from
Rs.152.20 crore in FY23(A) to Rs.206.77 crore in FY24(A) driven by improvement in
revenue from computers & IT services. Further, the new service contracts along with
timely delivering of service also support the revenue in FY24. The EBITDA margin of the
company also witnessed improvement from 9.67% in FY23 (A) to 11.52% in FY24(A)
mainly on the back of increase in revenue from sale of services coupled with operating
cost optimisation. Further, the PAT margin also improved from 5.85% in FY23 (A) to 7.56
% in FY24(A) on the back of rise in absolute EBITDA. On the back of improved profitability,
net cash accruals of the company have also improved to Rs.19.17 crore in FY24.
• Satisfactory capital structure and comfortable debt protection metrics
Financial risk profile of the company continued to remain satisfactory marked by its
comfortable capital structure as on the account closing dates, satisfactory debt coverage
indicators and minimal near to medium term debt repayment obligations. With minimal
long-term debt in the capital structure, the debt equity ratio though moderated yet
remained comfortable at 0.12x as on March 31, 2024 [0.05x as on March 31,2023]. The
overall gearing ratio and total indebtedness marked by TOL/ATNW also remained
comfortable at 0.12x and 0.56x respectively as on March 31, 2024. The debt protection
parameters of the company continue to remain comfortable, marked by interest coverage
ratio at 16.54x as on March 31,2024 (10.79x as on March 31,2023) and Total
Debt/EBITDA at 0.54x as on March 31,2024(0.73x as on March 31,2023). The DSCR also
remained comfortable at 11.54x in FY24.
Key Rating Weaknesses
3
• Competition from major player in the industry, technology obsolescence risk.
IT/ITES industry is very competitive and mostly organised in India. The company faces
stiff competition from large industries impacting its pricing flexibility; in addition to the
ability of the company to acquire new customers also. There are various players catering
to the same market which leads to limiting the bargaining power of the company and
consequent pressure on its margins. The company’s modest scale of operations restricted
its operational and financial flexibility to an extent. Any adverse technological changes
would have an adverse impact on the revenues of the company. Though the company is
empanelled by various Government agencies for IT needs, the orders are majorly
awarded through the tender-based system.
• Working capital intensive nature of operations
The operation of the company is working capital intensive. The company raises bills after
the completion of the work contract. The company’s client base majorly constitutes of
government entities, where in the payments is elongated owing to procedural delays. The
average collection period stood elongated at 110 days in FY24 (A). The company makes
payment to the creditors as and when the payments are realized. The procurement
remains majority contract backed. Therefore, the company maintain minimal inventory in
form of work in process for the work under execution.

cash accruals of Rs.30.00 crore- Rs.47.00 crore vis-à-vis its debt repayment obligation of
Rs.3.43 crore - Rs.3.96 crore during FY25-27. Moreover, the overall gearing remained

Rating Rationale Rating Rationale December 27, 2024 | Mumbai Beardsell LimitedIssuer not cooperating, based on best-available information; Rating continues to be ‘CRISIL B+/Stable Issuer not cooperating' Rating ActionRs.5 Crore Fixed DepositsCRISIL B+ /Stable (ISSUER NOT COOPERATING*; Rating continues at the same level)Note: None of the Directors on CRISIL Ratings Limited’s Board are members of rating committee and thus do not participate in discussion or assignment of any ratings. The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities*Issuer did not cooperate; based on best-available information Please note that the rating(s) are based on best available information with the credit rating agency: the entity whose debt is being published via this rating rationale did not provide the requisite information needed to conduct the rating exercise or did not provide the No Default Statements (NDS) for the last three months and is therefore classified as 'non cooperative'. Non cooperation by Issuer CRISIL Ratings has been consistently following up with Beardsell Limited (BSL) for obtaining information through letter and email dated November 11, 2024 among others, apart from telephonic communication. However, the issuer has remained non cooperative. ‘The investors, lenders and all other market participants should exercise due caution with reference to the rating assigned/reviewed with the suffix 'ISSUER NOT COOPERATING' as the rating is arrived at without any management interaction and is based on best available or limited or dated information on the company. Such non co-operation by a rated entity may be a result of deterioration in its credit risk profile. These ratings with 'ISSUER NOT COOPERATING' suffix lack a forward looking component.’ Detailed Rationale Despite repeated attempts to engage with the management, CRISIL Ratings failed to receive any information on either the financial performance or strategic intent of BSL, which restricts CRISIL Ratings’ ability to take a forward looking view on the entity's credit quality. CRISIL Ratings believes that rating action on BSL is consistent with ‘Assessing Information Adequacy Risk’. Based on the last available information, the rating on fixed deposits of BSL continues to be ‘CRISIL B+/Stable Issuer Not Cooperating’. CRISIL Ratings has consolidated the business and financial risk profile of BSL with subsidiaries Saideep Polytherm (SP) and Sarovar Insulation Private Limited (SIPL) together referred to as Beardsell group. BSL, SP and SIPL are engaged in similar line of business. SIPL is a 100% subsidiary of BSL, while SP is 99.99% owned by BSL. About the Group Incorporated in 1936 in Chennai and currently promoted by the Anumolu family, BSL manufactures polystyrene sheets and prefabricated panels. Operations are managed by Mr. Bharat Anumolu. The company is listed on the National Stock Exchange. SIPL is 100% subsidiary of BSL and is based out of Coimbatore.

Rationale and key rating drivers
Ratings assigned to bank facilities of Kriti Industries (India) Limited (KIL) continue to derive strength from the vast experience of
its promoters with established operations in plastic pipes and fittings industry, widespread distribution network with diversified
application and clientele and stable demand outlook for the plastic pipes industry. Ratings also factor in KIL’s growing scale of
operation, improvement in profitability and adequate liquidity.
However, ratings continue to remain constrained due to its moderate capital structure and debt coverage indicators, seasonality
associated with demand for KIL’s products, presence in a highly competitive plastic pipes manufacturing industry, and
susceptibility of its profitability to volatile raw material prices and foreign exchange fluctuation risk.
Rating sensitivities: Factors likely to lead to rating actions
Positive factors
• Significant increase in its scale of operations to more than ₹1,000 crore through greater geographical diversification along
with improvement in its profit before interest, lease rentals, depreciation, and taxation (PBILDT) margin to over 10% on a
sustained basis.
• Improvement in capital structure with overall gearing below 0.75x and total outside liability to total net worth (TOL/TNW)
below 1.50x on a sustained basis.
Negative factors
• Significant decline in scale of operations along with moderation in PBILDT margin below 5% on sustained basis
• Any debt funded capex or stretch in working capital requirements leading to deterioration in its overall gearing beyond 1.75x
times on sustained basis
• Elongation in its gross operating days beyond 180 days on a sustained basis.
Analytical approach: Standalone
Outlook: Stable
The stable outlook reflects CARE Ratings’ expectation that KIL will continue to benefit from its established presence in the pipe
industry and its widespread distribution network.
Detailed description of key rating drivers:
Key strengths
Volume-driven growth in scale of operations and improvement in profitability
KIL’s total operating income (TOI) reported healthy volume driven growth of 18% y-o-y and increased to ₹867.10 crore as
compared to ₹732.52 crore in FY24 backed by increase in sales volume across all three segments. This was offset to some extent
by decline in sales realisation with normalisation of PVC prices. While major contribution to sales continued from agricultural
products (~63% of TOI), which registered volume growth of 17% y-o-y, sales volume of industrial and building products increased

Press Release
significantly by 59% and 63% y-o-y, respectively in FY24. KIL has small presence in the micro irrigation segment and it is expected
to remain at similar level. Further, the company reported stable TOI of ₹257.16 crore in Q1FY25.
The company’s PBILDT margin improved to 6.91% in FY24 with stabilisation of PVC price which had shown a declining trend for
most of FY23, resulting in inventory and operating losses in FY23. PBILDT margin further improved to 9.45% in Q1FY25 with
some volatility in PVC prices resulting in inventory gain duringin . However, with prices stabilising, CARE Ratings expects KIL’s
PBILDT margin to be in the range of 6-8% in the near term.
Established operations in plastic pipes and fittings, wide-spread distribution network and diversified clientele
KIL has over three decades of track record in the plastic pipe industry. In terms of capacity, it has 22 extrusion lines for PVC, 14
extrusion lines for high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and drip irrigation, and 25 injection moulding machines. The company’s
product profile includes PVC-based irrigation pipes, chlorinated PVC (CPVC)-based building products, low-density
polyethylene (LDPE)-based micro-irrigation application pipes, medium-density polyethylene (MDPE)-based gas distribution pipes,
HDPE-based transportation application pipes and drip irrigation systems, among others. It has the capacity of manufacturing
polymer extruded pipes from 20 mm to 710 mm diameter.
Furthermore, KIL has a wide distribution network with more than 400 dealers spread across 16 states in the country, with central
India mainly Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan being the major revenue generating states. KIL sells PVC pipes under
the brand name of “Kasta”. The company enjoys long standing relationship with some reputed customers in its industrial segment
across city gas distribution (CGD), telecom, and infrastructure sectors. The share of agriculture sector (including micro-drip
irrigation) in net sales continue to remain high at 63% of net sales in FY24 followed by 26% from industrial (CGD and telecom
companies) sector, and balance 11% from infrastructure/building products.
Experienced and competent management having more than three decades of industry experience
Shiv Singh Mehta, a qualified engineer with a master’s degree in business administration, is KIL’s Chairman and Managing Director,
managing the company’s overall operations. He is assisted by his son, Saurabh Singh Mehta, Director, and his wife, Purnima
Mehta, whole-time Director, in managing the company’s overall functions. The company’s directors are well qualified and have
over three decades of industry experience. KIL’s board of directors also includes renowned independent directors, Rakesh Kalra
(former managing director of Eicher Motors Limited), Manoj Fadnis (former president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants
of India [ICAI], New Delhi, for 2015-16 and vice president of ICAI for 2014-15), and Chandrasekharan Bhaskar (Managing Director
of Xpro India Limited).
Its group company Kriti Nutrients Limited (KNL; rated ‘CARE A-; Stable/CARE A2+’) is engaged in edible oil refining, solvent
extraction, and manufacturing soya value-added products at its manufacturing facility in Madhya Pradesh.
Stable demand outlook
Demand for pipes is catalysed by growth of agricultural, real estate, petroleum, gas, and telecom industries. Demand outlook for
the Indian plastic pipes industry is expected to be stable with increase in government spending on construction and infrastructure
and a thrust to the agriculture sector by higher targeted production and productivity and more availability of credit with focus on
micro-irrigation segment supported by schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY), Jal Shakti Abhiyan,
and Jal Jeevan Mission among others. Har Ghar Nal se Jal initiative aims to provide piped water supply to every household in
rural India, which will also drive demand for the pipe industry. A rise in population, growing urbanisation, and increasing income
level is projected to drive the demand for the housing sector, which in turn, could drive the demand for PVC pipes and fittings.
Key weaknesses
Moderate capital structure and debt coverage indicators
The capital structure of KIL continued to remain moderate marked by overall gearing of 1.61x as on March 31, 2024 (PY: 1.67x).
However, it improved to 1.27x as on June 30, 2024, with reduction in working capital borrowings. Further, with improvement in
profitability, debt coverage indicators improved but continued to remain moderate with PBILDT interest coverage of 2.86x and
total debt to gross cash accruals (TD/GCA) of 5.77x in FY24. They further improved to 4.24x and 4.06x, respectively as on June
30, 2024, with increased profitability in Q1FY25.
Further, KIL issued warrants amounting to ₹150 crore in June 2024, payment of which shall be made within 18 months. Out of
this, ₹37.50 crore has been received in current year. These funds shall be used for capex/general corporate purpose and the
company does not plan on availing term debt for its capex plans. The capex shall be towards expansion of capacity for building
products and column pipes and for setting up another plant to increase KIL’s geographical reach. CARE Ratings expects the capital
structure to be moderate in the near term, however it is expected to improve over time with augmentation of net worth base
post this warrant issue.

Press Release
Susceptibility of profitability to volatile raw material prices and foreign exchange fluctuation risk
Raw material is the major cost for KIL which accounted for ~80% of total cost of sales in FY24. The primary raw material consumed
by KIL is PVC resin which is a crude derivative and its price is directly linked to the crude oil price movement which remained
volatile and high inventory holding due to seasonality, affects realisation and consequently the company’s profitability. Domestic
manufacturers are also affected by forex volatility affecting crude oil prices and import duty changes on polymers. A significant
portion of the total polymer requirement in India is met through imports due to inadequate domestic manufacturing capacity.
KIL majorly procures its PVC requirement domestically from Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) while some portion of requirement
is also met through imports thus exposing it to supplier concentration risk and volatility in foreign exchange (~9% of its raw
material requirement was met from import market in FY24 [PY: 28%]) with nil export. However, the company enters forward
contracts for hedging foreign exchange exposures against imports, partially mitigating the risk.
Competitive industry landscape and seasonality associated with business
A significant portion of the Indian plastic pipes industry comprises of unorganised players considering low entry barriers and
commoditised product resulting in high competition and limited pricing power. KIL faces stiff competition from much larger
organised sector players with nationwide brands like ‘Astral’, ‘Prince’, ‘Finolex’, ‘Supreme’, and ‘Ashirwad’, among others. High
competitive intensity restricts profitability margins of the smaller plastic pipe manufacturers with regional presence. However, KIL
has strong presence in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan where its brand ‘Kasta’ enjoys good market share, especially in the
agriculture segment. The company’s sales are seasonal with Q1 (pre-monsoon) and Q3 (post-monsoon) together contributing
~60-65% of annual sales when there is high demand from agriculture, construction, and infrastructure segments.
Liquidity: Adequate
KIL has adequate liquidity with healthy cash accruals against its debt repayment obligations and cushion available from unutilised
working capital limits. It is expected to earn GCA of ~₹35 - 40 crore as against its debt repayment obligation of ₹13 -15 crore in
the medium term. Average fund and non-fund based working capital utilisation remained moderate at 57% and 76% for past 12
months ended July 2024. KIL reported healthy cashflow from operations (CFO) of ₹57.59 crore in FY24 as compared to ₹26.83
crore in FY23.
The company’s operations are highly working capital intensive with gross current assets days of ~112 days in FY24 (FY23: 126
days), primarily due to higher inventory holding period because of the seasonality associated with agri-products, its diverse
product offerings, and requirement to keep the minimum inventory level per demand estimate. Owing to seasonality associated
with its agriculture business segment, KIL must hold inventory prior to the season commences (Q1: pre-monsoon and Q3: post
monsoon). However, it has efficient collection period. The company usually avails letter of credit (LC) facility with an usance
period of 90 days, allowing longer credit period with its suppliers. KIL’s operating cycle improved from 49 days in FY23 to 38 days
in FY24.

SJS Enterprises Limited: Ratings upgraded; outlook revised to Stable from Positive
Summary of rating action
Previous Rated Amount Current Rated Amount
Instrument* Rating Action
(Rs. crore) (Rs. crore)
Long term fund-based limits – [ICRA]AA-; upgraded from [ICRA]A+;
28.00 28.00
Working Capital outlook revised to stable from positive
Total 28.00 28.00
*Instrument details are provided in Annexure-I
Rationale
The upgrade in the long-term rating of SJS Enterprises Limited (SJS) referred to as the Group or the company, reflects its
strengthened business profile and increased scale of operations, which are expected to sustain, going forward. The ratings also
factor in the improved diversification of its product portfolio, with the addition of several technologically advanced products
like In-Mold Decoration (IMD), In-Mold Labelling (IML), In-Mold Electronics (IME) and In-Mold Forming (IMF) as well as its
expanded customer base, largely driven by the ramp-up in its acquired businesses of Exotech Plastics Private Limited (Exotech)
and Walter Pack Automotive Products India Private Limited (WPI). Its financial profile and liquidity position also remain strong,
underpinned by healthy profitability, comfortable capital structure and robust debt coverage indicators.
SJS’ revenues have expanded at a healthy compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36% over the past four years with total
consolidated revenues of Rs. 628.0 crore in FY2024, aided by increase in its content per vehicle. Revenues grew further by 18%
on a YoY basis in H1 FY2025 as SJS has successfully ramped up the operations of its recently acquired businesses. Moreover,
the operating profit margins remained healthy at 26% in H1 FY2025, with increasing share of technologically advanced
products. With growing demand for premium aesthetics in the automotive segment, SJS is expected to sustain the revenue
momentum, going forward, supported by the increasing share of business from existing as well as new customers, growth
from new product launches and entry into new geographies, driven by the acquired businesses. Concurrently, SJS is expected
to maintain its strong financial profile. The rating also considers SJS’ extensive experience in the manufacturing of self-adhesive
labels and the established relationship it enjoys with its reputed clientele [original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and tier-
1 suppliers].
ICRA however notes the company’s moderate, albeit improving, scale of operations. Notwithstanding the healthy growth in
revenues, ICRA notes that the scale of operations of SJS remains moderate vis-à-vis other entities in the similar rating category.
Further, around ~70% of its consolidated revenues is derived from the automotive segment, which is vulnerable to cyclicality
in demand. The cyclicality is partly mitigated, to an extent, as the white goods and farm equipment segments accounted for
around 30% of its revenues in FY2024. SJS’ customer concentration remains moderately high, with the top five customers
accounting for 52% of the consolidated revenues in FY2024, nonetheless the same is expected to reduce with addition of new
customers.
The Stable outlook on the long-term rating reflects ICRA’s expectation that SJS’ credit profile will continue to remain
adequately supported by the steady increase in revenues and healthy profit margins. This will limit its dependence on debt
and lead to continued healthy debt coverage indicators.

Key rating drivers and their description
Credit strengths
Extensive experience in manufacturing self-adhesive labels; improved product diversification supported by acquisitions –
SJS was established in 1987 and has more than three decades of experience in the manufacturing of self-adhesive labels. The
company has four manufacturing units – one in Bengaluru (Karnataka), two in Pune (Maharashtra) and one in Manesar
(Haryana). SJS has long relationships with its suppliers and equipment vendors, resulting in a constant and uninterrupted
supply of raw materials. With established supply chain, manufacturing capabilities and delivery mechanism in place, the
company supplied over 169 million parts to more than 180 customer locations across 22 countries in FY2024.
Its product offerings include decals and body graphics, 2D appliques and dials, 3D appliques and dials, 3D lux badges, domes,
overlays, aluminium badges. SJS has also been undertaking efforts to further expand its product portfolio through in-house
product development, as well as inorganic investments. In this regard, its recent acquisitions of WPI and Exotech for its high-
value decorative parts such as in-mold decoration (IMD), in-mold labelling (IML), in-mold electronics (IME) and in-mold forming
(IMF) components. This has helped the company further strengthen its product and customer profile and diversify its offerings.
Established relationship with reputed clients – The company has forged strong relationships with its customers, supporting
its growth over the years. The company benefits from its relationships with tier-1 automotive suppliers and automotive OEMs,
especially in the 2W segment such as TVS Motor Company Limited (TVS), Bajaj Auto Limited (Bajaj), and Honda Motorcycle &
Scooter India Private Limited (HMSI), among others. Further, it serves reputed brands such as Whirlpool, Samsung, and
Electrolux, among others, in the white goods segments. It has been associated with its key customers for more than two
decades and receives incremental orders from them for their new models and requirements. Moreover, with the acquisition
of Exotech and WPI, SJS added four-wheeler (4W) brands such as Mahindra & Mahindra Limited, John Deere India Private
Limited, Tata Motors Limited, Maruti Suzuki India Limited, Autoliv Inc., Novateur Electrical & Digital Systems Private Limited
and Toyota Tsusho India Private Limited to its customer base. ICRA notes that the recent acquisition of Exotech and WPI are
synergistic to SJS’ business and provides it with opportunities to cross sell its products across a diversified customer base and
strengthen its order book.
Increasing scale of operations, comfortable financial profile with healthy profitability and return indicators – SJS’ revenues
have expanded at a healthy CAGR of 36% over the past four years with total revenues of Rs. 628.0 crore in FY2024, aided by
an increase in its content per vehicle. Revenues grew further by 18% on a YoY basis in H1 FY2025 as SJS successfully ramped
up the operations of its recently acquired businesses. With growing demand for premium aesthetics in the automotive
segment, SJS is expected to sustain the revenue momentum, going forward, supported by the increasing share of business
from existing as well as new customers, growth from new products launches and entry into new geographies. Driven by the
acquired businesses, SJS’ financial risk profile remains comfortable, characterised by healthy profitability and a strong capital
structure. Established supply chain, manufacturing capabilities along with continuous development of technologically
advanced products have led to a healthy gross margin of over 50% during the last three years. At the consolidated level, the
OPM improved to 26% in H1 FY2025, led by higher sales and enhanced operational efficiencies. In H1 FY2025, SJS fully repaid
the term loan, making the company long-term debt free. This resulted in a healthy capital structure with an overall gearing of
0.04 times as on September 30,2024. The debt coverage indicators also stood robust with total debt vis-à-vis the operating
profit of 0.1 times and an interest cover of 24.7 times in H1 FY2025.
Credit challenges
Moderate, albeit growing scale of operations – Although SJS’ revenues have grown at a healthy rate, it continues to remain
moderate relative to other entities in the rating category. With modest content per vehicle on its products, SJS’s revenue stood
at Rs. 628.5 crore in FY2024 and Rs. 381.4 crore in H1 FY2025. Despite its moderate scale, ICRA notes that the company’s
operating margin and return indicators continue to remain healthy, indicating its strong operational profile. In terms of
segment diversification, it derives a large part of its revenues from the passenger vehicle segment, followed by two wheelers
www.icra .in 2
Page |
(2W) and the remaining from the white goods and farm equipment segments. Going forward, the introduction of new
products and acquisition of new customers are expected to drive revenue growth organically, helping it expand its
scale of operations and mitigate this risk.
Exposed to inherent cyclicality in the automotive industry – With SJS deriving a major portion of its revenues from the 2W
and 4W segments, which together accounted for 73% of revenues in FY2024, its operating income remains vulnerable to the
cyclicality in these segments. Its revenue growth in FY2019 and FY2020 was impacted by the demand slowdown in these
sectors. However, the company’s revenues gradually improved from FY2021 on the back of revival in demand. The cyclicality
is partly mitigated, to an extent, as the white goods and farm equipment segments accounted for around 20% of its revenues
in FY2024. Subsequently, in H1 FY2025, despite the slowdown in the industry (especially in the PV segment), the company
outperformed the industry volumes, led by the ramp-up in acquired business as well as growth in export markets. However,
in case of the 2W segment, the growth was lower than the industry level.
Moderately high customer concentration – Moreover, at a consolidated level, customer concentration remains moderately
high with top five customers accounting for 52% of its revenues in FY2024. Nonetheless, ICRA derives comfort from SJS’
established relationships and high share of business enjoyed with these customers, especially in the product segments catered
to by WPI and Exotech. Further with the addition of new customers, the same is expected to reduce.
Environment and Social Risks
Environmental considerations: SJS is not directly exposed to climate transition risks emanating from the likelihood of
tightening emission control requirements, with the bulk of its products used across different fuel powertrains, but its
automotive manufacturing customers remain highly exposed to the same. Accordingly, SJS’ prospects remain linked to the
ability of its customers to meet tightening emission control requirements. The company also uses raw materials such as plastic,
polyethene terephthalate, copper, nickel, aluminium, paints, metallised polyester, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polycarbonate,
inks, chemicals and adhesives which, if improperly stored or disposed of, may result in severe environmental damage. Thus,
the handling of raw materials and waste management are important. The company has a structured process to ensure the
proper storage of raw materials and recycling of waste generated during the manufacturing process. The manufacturing
facilities of the company are compliant with the environment, health and safety management systems. Moreover, SJS
Bengaluru plant is certified as LEED(Leadership in energy & environmental Design) Gold by the US Green Building council and
verified by Green Business certification Inc.
Social considerations: The company is exposed to social risks such as worker shortages and changing consumer preferences.
The company has taken initiatives for employee empowerment, diversity in the workplace, and employee development and
healthcare. Another social risk that component suppliers face pertains to product quality, wherein instances of low quality and
standards and high warranty costs may lead to financial implication and harm the reputation and create a more long-lasting
adverse impact on demand.
Liquidity position: Strong
SJS’ liquidity position is strong, supported by healthy cash accruals and undrawn limits available of more than Rs. 80 crore as
on September 30, 2024. ICRA expects the company’s cash flow from operations to remain robust, driven by healthy
profitability, led by growing demand and increasing share of business with OEMs. Moreover, the company fully repaid its term
loan in H1 FY2025 and has no plans to avail debt in the near term. Against this, the company plans to incur capex of Rs.100
crore in the next two years, which will be funded through internal accruals. Out of the total capex, Rs. 80 crore pertains to
capacity expansion in Exotech, and the balance relates to maintenance capex.
Rating sensitivities
Positive factors – ICRA could upgrade the rating if SJS is able to demonstrate a significant increase in its revenues while
maintaining healthy profitability and satisfactory debt coverage indicators and liquidity position on a sustained basis.
www.icra .in 3
Page |
Negative factors – ICRA may downgrade the rating if the company reports any significant weakening in its operating
performance and/or earnings, which adversely impacts its debt coverage indicators and/or the liquidity position on a sustained
basis. Specific credit metrics that could result in a rating downgrade would include total debt vis-à-vis OPBDITA increasing to
more than 1.3 times on a sustained basis.

For arriving at the ratings, ICRA has considered the consolidated financials of SJS. As on
Consolidation/Standalone
September 30, 2024, SJS has three subsidiaries that has been enlisted in Annexure-II
About the company
SJS was established in 1987 by Mr. V. Srinivasan, Mr. K.A. Joseph and Mr. Sivakumar as a partnership concern, which was
converted into a private limited company in June 2005. In September 2015, Evergraph Holdings Pte Ltd, a subsidiary of
Singapore-based private equity firm, Everstone Capital, acquired a majority stake in SJS through the secondary purchase.
Evergraph had acquired the 26% stake owned by Serigraph Inc, US, an American specialty printing company, and the remaining
from the promoters of the company. From 2021 to 2024, following the company’s IPO, Evergraph has been diluting its stake
in the entity as a part of its exit strategy and as on May 24,2024 , it completely diluted its stake in the company. Post exit of
Evergraph, Mr. K. A. Joseph, Managing Director, holds 21.55% stake in the company as on September-2024. In November 2021,
the company was listed on NSE and BSE.
SJS manufactures self-adhesive labels such as automotive dials (automotive dashboard interior), overlays, exterior decals (two
and four wheelers), badges and logos for the automotive, electronics and appliance industries, with the automotive industry
contributing a major portion to its revenues. The company has also been engaging in inorganic growth to expand its product
portfolio and clientele. In April 2021, it acquired Exotech at a consideration of around Rs. 64 crore to expand its presence in
the chrome plating business. Further, in April 2023, it acquired a 90.1% stake in WPI at a consideration of Rs. 238.6 crore, for
expanding its presence in the IMD, IML, IME and IMF components.

# Though a part of the long-term loans of Hikal are denominated in foreign currency, ICRA’s ratings for the same are on national rating scale, as distinct from an
international rating scale
Rationale
The reaffirmation of ratings for Hikal Limited (Hikal) factors in its established business position and diversified presence in
manufacturing APIs1 and intermediates for pharmaceutical and crop protection industries. The company is also expected to
grow gradually in the animal healthcare segment, following the successful validation of its products from the facility located
at Panoli (Gujarat), commissioned in December 2023. Moreover, Hikal has a reputable and diversified client base, including
some leading global innovator companies and it enjoys exclusive supply contracts with some of its large customers. The ratings
also factor in Hikal’s adequate financial risk profile, supported by some reduction in leverage over 9M FY2025. While debt
protection metrics were suppressed in the past on account of the debt-funded capex undertaken over the past few years, total
debt (excluding lease liability) reduced to Rs. 731.0 crore as on December 31, 2024 from Rs. 814.7 crore as on March 31, 2024
and ICRA expects its debt to continue reducing gradually over the medium term. This, coupled with an expected enhancement
in revenues and profitability with gradual stabilisation of the crop-protection industry, is expected to aid the improvement of
Hikal’s financial risk profile.
Hikal generated revenues of Rs. 1,307.4 crore in 9M FY2025 with a 2.9% YoY growth after a decline of 11.8% in FY2024. The
recovery in revenues was driven by a 7.1% YoY growth in revenues from the pharmaceutical segment to Rs. 816.8 crore while
revenues from the crop protection segment contracted by 3.4% to Rs. 490.6 crore. That said, the contraction in the crop
protection segment has moderated from the 24.4% decline in 9M FY2024 and ICRA expects the revenues from the segment to
stabilise and gradually grow over the medium term, supported by the normalisation of the channel inventory in the industry,
leading to some improvement in demand. The company’s profitability also improved, registering an OPM2 of 15.7% in 9M
FY2025 as against 12.7% in FY2023. This was aided by a gradual improvement in the profitability of the pharmaceutical
segment, driven by demand enhancement during the period. While overall profitability remains moderated on account of the
1 Active pharmaceutical ingredients
2 Operating profit margin

Page
| 1
reduction in the profitability of the crop-protection segment, ICRA expects gradual improvement in the same, supported by
the stabilisation/ improvement of demand in the crop-protection industry.
However, Hikal’s OPM remains vulnerable to adverse movement in key raw material prices, which is also demonstrated by the
volatility in its OPM in the recent past. Its profitability also remains exposed to volatility in foreign currency rates on account
of its exports. This is partly mitigated by a natural hedge on account of Hikal’s imports. The ratings also factor in Hikal’s product
concentration with its key molecule-Gabapentin, contributing up to 35-40% of its revenues from the pharmaceutical segment
while over 50% of the revenues from the crop protection segment continue to be driven by the top three products. However,
the risk is mitigated by its diversified customer base and an established presence in its key products like Gabapentin and
Thiabendazole. The ratings also factor in Hikal’s high working capital intensity due to the elevated inventory levels required
for its generic portfolio and contract manufacturing.
Hikal is involved in various regulatory actions/ litigations, including the ongoing legal proceedings related to the company’s
alleged involvement in a gas leak accident at Surat (Sachin GIDC area) in Gujarat. The NGT3 imposed a penalty (Rs. 17.45 crore
in October 2022) on Hikal on account of the alleged violation of environmental laws, which the company has contested legally
before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, and the matter remains sub judice. Moreover, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has, vide its
order dated April 8, 2024, stayed the recovery of the penalty imposed by NGT. ICRA also notes the suit filed by Hikal’s
promoters, Mr. Jaidev Hiremath and Mrs. Sugandha Hiremath, under the Specific Relief Act, 1963, in the High Court Judicature
at Mumbai on March 18, 2023, seeking specific performance of obligations cast on the BNK Group4 pursuant to a family
arrangement between Mr. Babasaheb N Kalyani and his parents, whereby the shares of the company held by KICL5 and BFIL6
were required to be transferred to the Hiremath family. Based on Hikal’s public disclosures and discussion with its
management, ICRA understands that these developments have not had any adverse impact on the company’s operations or
its banking arrangements and the Company doesn’t envisage any financial implication arising out the said suit. However, ICRA
will continue to monitor the developments in these matters and their possible impact on the credit risk profile of the company,
if any.
The Stable outlook on the long-term rating reflects ICRA’s expectation that Hikal will report higher internal accruals, supported
by a pipeline of generic APIs and scale-up of revenues from the crop protection and animal healthcare facilities, thus supporting
the improvement in its credit metrics.
Key rating drivers and their description
Credit strengths
Diversified presence in pharmaceutical and crop protection industries, supported by increasing presence in animal
healthcare – The pharmaceutical segment generated ~62% of Hikal’s revenues in FY2024 and 9M FY2025 and the remaining
was driven by the crop protection segment. Moreover, the animal healthcare segment, which currently forms part of the
pharmaceutical segment, is also expected to grow gradually over the medium term. The manufacturing facility for the animal
healthcare segment was commissioned by the company in December 2023 and the validation process has been progressing
well with the validation of seven products already completed, and the balance is expected to be completed over the next few
months. The diversification has helped Hikal in offsetting the negative impacts in a particular industry. For instance, while the
revenues from the crop protection segment dropped by ~25% over FY2024 on account of the headwinds in the industry, stable
revenue generation by the pharmaceutical segment curtailed the loss of revenue for the company to an extent.

| 2
Reputed and diversified client base – Hikal has a strong clientele, which includes several reputable and leading global
innovator companies. Moreover, the customer base for both segments is well diversified. The top three customers of the
pharmaceutical segment generated 21% of Hikal’s revenues from the segment in FY2024. The company is a market leader for
Gabapentin, which is supplied to various global generic companies as well as innovators. In the crop protection segment, the
top three customers generated ~52% of revenues in FY2024. However, the customer concentration risk is mitigated by Hikal’s
established presence and leadership position in the Thiabendazole market and exclusive supply contracts with large customers.
Adequate financial risk profile – Notwithstanding some moderation on account of the debt-funded capex over the last few
years and the moderation in performance due to the headwinds in the industry, the financial risk profile of Hikal has remained
adequate, supported by healthy capitalisation and an adequate liquidity position. Moreover, a gradual reduction in debt and
improvement in scale and profitability of the base business and increasing contribution from the new manufacturing facilities
is expected to result in some improvement in these indicators over the near to medium term. As on March 31, 2024, Hikal had
a TD/TNW and TOL/TNW7 of 0.7x and 1.1x, respectively. Moreover, these indicators are expected to gradually improve over
the near to medium term, supported by the recovery in the crop protection segment, and reduced reliance on debt to fund
the capex with the completion of the animal healthcare and multipurpose manufacturing facilities.
Credit challenges
Profitability vulnerable to competitive pressures, adverse movement in raw material prices and forex rates – Hikal’s
profitability remains vulnerable to volatility in raw material prices and the competitive pressures in the industry. The reduction
in demand and adverse pricing pressure in recent times led to a reduction in its OPM to 15.7% in 9M FY2025 and 15% in FY2024
from historical levels of 17-19%. While the PM is expected to recover gradually with the stabilisation of the industry, the
company shall continue to remain exposed to competitive pressures and volatility in raw material prices. However, its ability
to pass on raw material costs to customers with a lag of three to six months can partly mitigate the pricing risk. Hikal is also
exposed to adverse movement in foreign currency rates, however, it enjoys a natural hedge on account of its imports.
High working capital intensity – The working capital intensity of Hikal has historically remained high with net working
capital/operating income of 30-35%. Its working capital intensity was recorded as 34.0% in FY2024. The nature of contracts,
especially in contract manufacturing, requires Hikal to maintain a minimum inventory level to ensure uninterrupted flow of
supplies to customers, besides stocking requirements on account of a significant dependence on China.
Significant debt-funded capex likely to keep coverage indicators moderate over near term; achieving desired level of scale-
up in capacities remains to be seen – Hikal has undergone a high capex cycle over the last few years for developing the animal
healthcare and multipurpose manufacturing facilities and some capacity expansion in the pharmaceutical segment, in addition
to the general repair and maintenance capex. The capex was partly funded through debt, leading to elevated debt levels over
the past few years. This, coupled with the moderation of performance on account of the headwinds faced by the industry, led
to some moderation of coverage indicators in the past. It had a total debt/OPBDITA and interest cover of 2.7x and 3.6x
respectively in 9M FY2025 as against 3.1x and 4.7x, respectively, in FY2024. However, the company’s debt requirement is
expected to reduce for the near to medium term with the commissioning of the new manufacturing facilities. This, along with
an expected gradual improvement in scale and profitability, shall lead to a gradual strengthening of Hikal’s coverage indicators.
However, timely scale-up of the two manufacturing facilities shall remain key for the improvement.
Product concentration risk, especially in the pharmaceuticals segment – Gabapentin continues to contribute at least 35-40%
to Hikal’s annual revenues, thus creating product concentration risk in the pharmaceutical segment. However, this is partly
mitigated by Hikal’s leadership position in the product. In the crop protection segment, the top three products contributed

62% to segmental revenues in 9M FY2025 (58% in FY2024). However, the risk is partly mitigated by the company’s established
track record and its leadership position as a supplier of Thiabendazole.
Environmental and social risks
Environmental considerations: Hikal does not face any major physical climate risk. However, it remains exposed to tightening
environmental regulations regarding the breach of waste and pollution norms, which can lead to an increase in operating costs
and new capacity instalment costs. This can also require capital investments to upgrade its effluent treatment infrastructure
to reduce the carbon footprint and waste generation. There has been increased scrutiny of its operations by the Maharashtra
Pollution Control Board (MPCB), GPCB and NGT, while the committee nominated by the NGT had also recommended a fine of
Rs. 17.45 crore on Hikal against which the company is seeking appropriate legal remedies. Any financial liability arising out of
these issues cannot be ascertained at the moment.
To address the associated risks, Hikal is strengthening its compliance policies and Standard Operating Procedures. It has started
using GPS tracking for all the trucks used for material transportation along with several other initiatives to address the concerns
related to the Surat incident. Hikal has also entered multiple power purchase agreements to procure renewable energy.
Social considerations: The industry faces social risks related to product safety and associated litigation risks, access to qualified
personnel for R&D and process engineering, and maintenance of high manufacturing compliance standards. Further,
Government interventions related to product bans and price caps/control also remain a social risk.
Liquidity position: Adequate
Hikal’s liquidity is adequate, supported by steady fund flow from operations, free cash and cash equivalents of Rs. 36.5 crore
as on September 30, 2024 and unutilised fund-based limits of ~Rs. 200 crore. The company’s annual repayments were ~Rs.
103.3 crore in FY2025 and is expected to be ~Rs. 131.5 crore in FY2026. Hikal’s cash accrual generation is expected to be more
than sufficient to meet its debt servicing obligations over the medium term. The company’s capex commitment is expected to
be Rs. 150-200 crore per annum between FY2025 and FY2027, which is projected to be financed partly by internal accruals and
by long-term debt.
Rating sensitivities
Positive factors – ICRA could upgrade Hikal’s ratings if it demonstrates healthy revenue growth and internal accrual generation,
resulting in the strengthening of its debt protection metrics and liquidity profile. Specific credit metrics that could lead to an
upgrade of Hikal’s rating include total debt/ OPBITDA below 1.5 times on a sustained basis.
Negative factors – Negative pressure on Hikal’s ratings could arise if considerable decline in revenue and internal accrual
generation, and/or stretch in working capital cycle results in weakening of the company’s liquidity position. Any adverse impact
of the ongoing litigations on the company’s operations or financial profile may also result in a rating downgrade. Moreover,
lower than anticipated accrual generation from the ongoing capacity expansion over the next few years, resulting in total
debt/OPBITDA exceeding 2.25 times on a sustained basis, may also trigger a rating downgrade.

Rationale
The ratings factor Thirumalai Chemicals Limited’s (TCL) established track record and strong market position in the Phthalic
Anhydride (PAN) segment in India and the diversification benefits from the sale of downstream derivative products such as
esters, food acids and Maleic Anhydride (MAN) by its subsidiary - Optimistic Organic SDN BHD (OOSB).The ratings also factor
in the healthy capacity utilisation of the Ranipet plant, reflecting the benefit of modernisation capex in the last few years.
Further, ICRA notes the diversification efforts undertaken by the company to supply MAN to other countries to improve the
realisations. ICRA expects the company’s medium-term performance to benefit from the favourable trade protection measures
taken by the Government of India (GoI) and a positive demand outlook in the domestic end-user industry.
The ratings are however, constrained by moderate operating margins and cash accruals in H1FY2025, though the same
improved from FY2024 levels. The moderation of margins continue to impact the coverage metrics. The operating margins
have been impacted on account of the weak Phthalic anhydride (PAN)-Orthoxylene (OX) spread amid global volatile scenario.
Moreover, there is pressure on Maleic anhydride’s (MAN) realisations and margins, which is likely to continue in the near term.
ICRA also notes that the company’s debt-funded capex plans have resulted in additional debt requirements and exerted
pressure on its capital structure and coverage indicators. The company also remains susceptible to project execution risks due
to its large capex plans. Timely completion of US project without any further cost and time overruns will continue to be a key
monitorable. The projects, once completed and stabilised, are expected to offer a favourable product portfolio and
geographical diversification and result in improved operating margins. The ratings also remain constrained by the exposure of
the profitability margins to fluctuation in raw material prices and TCL’s presence in commodity chemicals that limits its pricing
flexibility.
The Negative outlook on the long-term rating reflects pressure on TCL’s operating margins and its impact on the debt coverage
metrics on account of volatility in the PAN-OX spreads.

Key rating drivers and their description
Credit strengths
Extensive experience and market position in PAN – TCL is the second-largest player in India with a significant market share in
the domestic PAN industry. The company’s five decades of experience has resulted in established relationships with clients in
key end-user industries such as Plasticizers, copper phthalocyanine (CPC), Paints and Unsaturated polyresins (UPR). TCL also
has a longstanding relationship with Reliance Industries Limited, the supplier of the raw material, OX, and operates on an
assured offtake model.
Positive demand outlook in domestic end-user industries – Infrastructure investments and expansion of major end-user
industries is expected to improve the demand for PAN in the domestic market in the medium term. Trade protection metrics,
such as anti-dumping duty, and the mandatory Bureau of Indian Standards certification for PAN imports are expected to benefit
domestic PAN manufacturers.
Diversification into related chemicals – The company produces Phthalate esters and food acids, which are downstream
derivatives. The contribution of these products has grown over the years. The company also produces Maleic anhydride (MAN)
in its Malaysian subsidiary – OOSB. The company is also setting up a greenfield integrated food ingredients production facility
in the US. These initiatives would provide diversification benefits to the consolidated entity in the medium term.
Credit challenges
Presence in commodity chemical industry and competition from imports limit pricing flexibility – TCL’s realisations are
influenced by the overall demand-supply dynamics in a region, given the limited product differentiation and volatility in
feedstock Orthoxylene prices. The key end-user industries of the product are Plasticizers, Paints and Unsaturated Polyester
Resins, which are mainly used in the infrastructure, construction and automobile sectors. Hence, the demand is based on the
broader economic conditions. With regard to supply, the market dynamics change significantly based on the production and
consumption in key markets such as China, Korea and South East Asia. Though TCL has medium to long-term contracts with
many customers, the product realisations are volatile.
Going forward, as domestic demand is higher than the domestic capacity, the offtake risk for producers like TCL is low at
present and is likely to remain so in the near term. However, domestic PAN companies have undertaken significant capex.
Hence, once the capacities are stable, PAN is expected to be exported for a period of 1-2 years before domestic demand
matches the increased supply. Most of the end users of Phthalic anhydride are in infrastructure and the Government’s thrust
on infrastructure is likely to improve the growth rates for Phthalic anhydride in India. The company’s performance also remains
susceptible to the changes in Government policies and regulations regarding international trade and trade protection metrics.
Exposure of profitability margins to fluctuation in raw material price – The price of OX has been volatile and based on crude
price and the demand trends for other products from the xylene stream. The company’s product demand and its working
capital intensity are impacted during periods of high OX prices. TCL has, however, rationalised its production lead time and
inventory management in recent years, thereby strengthening its ability to pass on OX price changes to its customers.
Nonetheless, the company’s profit margin remains susceptible to the volatility in PAN-OX spreads, which depend on the
demand-supply dynamics of PAN in the region. The operating margins were impacted in FY2024 and H1FY2025 owing to the
reduced PAN-OX spreads and pressure on realisations from MAN, which is expected to continue in the near term. However,
ICRA notes the company’s diversification efforts to supply MAN to other countries where the realisations are expected to be
higher. Further, ICRA also notes that TCL’s ability to withstand the above-mentioned risks is better than the earlier downturns
due to several cost-control initiatives taken by the company in the last few years.
Large debt-funded capex plans and project execution risks – TCL is in the process of undertaking a large capex under a
subsidiary in the US to manufacture food acids, which will be predominantly debt funded. The project has witnessed delays
owing to the pandemic and various global tensions, delaying the shipments to the project site. The US project is expected to
be completed by mid-2025.
www.icra .in 2
Page |
The company has also undertaken the second phase of the Dahej project to add a PAN capacity of ~90,000 MTPA and fumaric
acid capacity of ~10,000 MT. The cost incurred is ~Rs. 750 crore, including the GST component of ~Rs. 110-120 crore. This
project is expected to be fully commissioned in the next couple of months. The ongoing capex at the US exposes the
consolidated entity to project execution risks and put pressure on the consolidated capital structure and coverage indicators
over the near to medium term.
Environmental and Social Risks
Safety and environmental health-related concerns associated with chemicals expose the industry to the risk of tightening
regulatory norms for the production, handling, disposal and transportation of chemical products. Further, in the event of
accidents, the litigation risks and liabilities for clean-up could be high. TCL has been a zero-liquid discharge company for the
past several years and has also invested in the latest technology at its water treatment facility. While TCL has a demonstrated
track record of running its operations safely, the nature of the risk (being low frequency-high impact) weighs on the ratings.
TCL has robust process safety management in place.
Further, operating responsibly is an imperative and instances of non-compliance with environmental, health, and safety norms
could have an adverse impact on the local community which could manifest in the form of protests, constraining the ability to
operate or expand the capacity. TCL hasn’t experienced/reported any incident suggestive of safety lapses in its manufacturing
facilities over the past several years and its ability to maintain the manufacturing controls would be a monitorable.
Liquidity position: Adequate
The company’s liquidity profile is adequate, supported by cash and cash equivalents of ~Rs. 237.33 crore at the consolidated
level as on September 30, 2024, and expected positive cash flows from operations in FY2025. The availability of unutilised
working capital limits and healthy cash balances support the company’s liquidity profile against expected debt repayment
obligations of Rs. 35-40 crore in FY2025 and equity requirement for the planned capex during this period.
Rating sensitivities
Positive Factors – A rating upgrade is unlikely in the near term owing to the Negative outlook. However, the outlook could be
revised to Stable if the company demonstrates a sustained improvement in margins that would improve the coverage metrics
while maintaining the working capital intensity.
Negative Factors - Pressure on the ratings could arise if there is a sustained decline in revenue and profitability, or a stretch
in the working capital cycle, along with a planned debt-funded capex, which will weaken the credit profile. The ratings may
be downgraded if the net debt/OPBITDA exceeds 2.0 times on a sustained basis.

The Outlook is Positive The instrument-wise rating actions are given below: Details of Instruments Instrument Type Date of Issuance Coupon Rate Maturity Date Size of Issue (million) Rating Assigned along with Outlook/Watch Rating Action Long-Term Issuer Rating - - - - IND A/Positive Affirmed Non-fund-based limits - - - INR33,019 IND A/Positive/IND A1 Affirmed Fund-based limits - - - INR17,931 IND A/Positive/IND A1 Affirmed Analytical Approach To arrive at the ratings, Ind-Ra continues to consider DBL’s standalone financials while adjusting the outstanding debt of those special purpose vehicles for which a corporate guarantee (CG) has been provided by the company. The agency also continues to factor in the equity commitments of DBL’s under-construction hybrid annuity model (HAM)-based projects and mine developer and operator projects. The agency has factored in the removal of the CG for the assets whose divesture has been completed and the CG provided to the debt raised at DBL Infra Assets Private Limited (DIAPL; 100% subsidiary of DBL) and DBL Infratech Private Limited (DIPL, ‘IND A(CE)’/Positive) to assess the overall adjusted debt levels. Detailed Rationale of the Rating Action The ratings and Positive Outlook reflect the agency’s expectation that DBL’s credit metrics and liquidity profile would remain comfortable and improve over FY25-FY26, aided by an improvement in its working capital cycle and receipt of pending inflows from the issuance of warrants and 26% stake sale in the HAM assets. While the net leverage and interest coverage ratios moderated during 1HFY25, the same are likely to recover during 2HFY25,  aided by the improvement in the working capital cycle. Furthermore, there have not been any major developments around the Central Bureau of Investigation's visit to DBL's premises and the residence of its executive director in Bhopal on 31 December 2021. DBL, in its public disclosure to the stock exchanges, had refuted all the charges and stated that the company’s executive director had been released from the custody of the investigating agency vide order dated 7 January 2022. Ind-Ra will continue to monitor the developments around the case and its impact on DBL’s credit risk profile. List of Key Rating Drivers Strengths- Credit Profile to remain comfortable in medium term- Stable revenue trajectory likely to continue over FY25-FY26Weaknesses- Diversified but shrinking order book- Timely monetisation of assets key for funding equity commitments Detailed Description of Key Rating Drivers Credit Profile to Remain Comfortable in Medium Term: Ind-Ra expects the net leverage (total standalone debt less unrestricted cash/EBITDA) to remain below 1.75x over FY25-FY27, backed by the proceeds from the warrant issuance and the divestment of the stake in its under-construction projects, which would likely happen over the same period. DBL’s net leverage reduced to 1.4x in FY24 (FY23: 2.7x; FY22: 4.0x), as the release of working capital during 4QFY24 led to lower working capital debt. However, the net leverage rose to 2.2x during 1HFY25, due to lower realisation of receivables. The net adjusted leverage (total standalone debt plus CG outstanding less unrestricted cash/EBITDA) reduced to 2.1x in FY24 (3.7x; 5.8x), the gross interest coverage (EBITDA/gross interest expenses) improved to 2.6x (1.9x;  1.3x) and the total outside liabilities (TOL)/EBITDA improved to 4.8x (7.1x;9.2x), partly on account of improved profitability and a decrease in overall gross debt. However, the interest coverage moderated during 1HFY25 to 2.0x (1HFY24: 2.4x) on account of higher utilisation of working capital limits.  Furthermore, with the release of CGs from the completed projects in FY25 and FY26 and the repayment of the debt at DIAPL and DIPL over FY25-FY27, Ind-Ra expects the net adjusted leverage (including CGs) to remain around 2.0x during FY25-FY27. Stable Revenue Trajectory Likely to Continue over FY25-FY26: During FY25-FY26, Ind-Ra expects DBL’s revenue to be largely in line or marginally lower than the levels achieved in FY24, as the corresponding order book has been largely on the lower side. The execution run-rates across sites are likely to remain at FY24 levels during this period, and the absence of large inflow of orders is likely to result in the revenue remaining in line and or being a tad lower than FY24 levels. Furthermore, the increase in the share of non-hybrid annuity mode road projects in the order book, the margins of which are on the lower side, are likely to result in the EBITDA margins sustaining between 10%-11%. The company achieved revenue of INR45,348 million in 1HFY25 (FY24: INR1,05,373 million; FY23: INR1,01,195 million) with an EBITDA margin of 10.7% (12.3%; 9.8%).  Ind-Ra expects DBL's EBITDA margin to remain stable at 10%-11% over FY25-FY27, with an absolute EBITDA of around INR10 billion (1HFY25: INR4,845 million; FY24: INR12,991 million; FY23: INR9,884 million).Diversified but Shrinking Order Book: DBL had a diversified order book of INR174 billion at end-September 2024 (FY24: INR240 billion; FY23: INR254 billion), which provides revenue visibility of 1.6x based on its FY24 revenue. The order book  had strong counterparties, with 76% of the orders being from central government authorities such as the National Highways Authority of India (‘IND AAA’/Stable), the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Northern Coalfields Limited, and Mahanadi Coalfields Limited, among others, which aid its payment security. Furthermore, the order book was diversified, given that 27% of the projects were from the roads, bridges and highways segment, 21% from irrigation (21%), 21% from mining, and the balance from the water supply, tunnelling, elevated metro, and special bridge segments. During 1HFY25, the company won only one order, which was worth INR11.4 billion, and it was under the tunnel segment. While DBL is geographically diversified, with orders spread across 14 states (including Union territories), the top three states contribute nearly 50% to the order book -  Jharkhand (22%), Madhya Pradesh (15%) and Gujarat (14%).  A few orders pertaining to the irrigation segments have not yet started despite these orders having been awarded a few years ago.  The cumulative order value of these yet-to-be-started orders has been discounted, and the effective order book at end-2QFY25 stood at INR164 billion, providing a moderate revenue visibility of 1.5x. Ind-Ra believes these discounted orders are unlikely be implemented over 2HFY25-FY27, given the delays in receiving various statutory and regulatory approvals. Timely Monetisation of Assets Key for Funding Equity Commitments: At end-1HFY25, DBL was in the process of  executing 12 HAM projects (11 under construction and one project received pre-commercial operation date in 3QFY25), along with one coal project and one build-operate-transfer project, namely Zuari Observatory Towers Limited. All these projects would jointly entail an estimated total equity commitment of INR3,340 million in 2HFY25; INR5,260 million in FY26; and INR3,110 million in FY27. Ind-Ra estimates the equity outflow over FY26-FY27 to be higher as the company would continue to bid for HAM projects, and the projects awarded in 2HFY25 and FY26 shall entail fresh equity commitments, amounting to a total outlay of INR12 billion over FY26-FY27. The primary source for equity commitments shall be internal accruals, proceeds from the sale of assets and the equity to be infused by the strategic partner.  The company estimates a cash inflow of INR614 million in 2HFY25, INR2,810 million in FY26 and INR2,690 million in FY27 and InviT units of INR6,450 million from stake sale of 26% in 11 HAM projects to the strategic partner. Additionally, the company expects to receive INR4,000 million in FY26 from the partner against issuance of warrants. Any delay in receipt of these funds or  monetisation of InviT units is likely to hamper the progress of the underlying projects where equity commitments are necessary. Liquidity Adequate; to be Further Improved by Warrant Issuances and Stake Sale: Despite likely impending equity commitments over 2HFY25-FY27, Ind-Ra expects DBL’s liquidity profile to be maintained over FY26-FY27, owing to the warrant issuance and the divestment of the 26% stake in its HAM portfolio to the strategic investor, Alpha Alternatives. In November 2023, DBL’s management announced its strategic alliance with Alpha Alternatives. The management has issued warrants worth around INR5.3 billion towards 10% stake sale in DBL. The company received INR1.3 billion in 4QFY24, and expects to receive the  balance by end-June 2025. At end-1HFY25, 26% equity had been divested in seven HAM projects. The proceeds shall be used to augment the equity commitments of DBL towards its under-construction and future HAM projects. DBL has debt repayment obligations of INR274.8 million in 4QFY25 and intends to be net debt negative in FY26. Ind-Ra estimates that the company would have equity commitment obligations of over INR12 billion during FY26-FY27, which are likely to be met through its internal accruals and monetisation proceeds. Hence, the inflows from its divestment and warrant issuance are a key rating monitorable and any delay in the receipt of divestment/warrant proceeds or the inability to monetise the infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) units or an increase in the working capital lock-up shall impact the overall liquidity profile. Any delays in the receipt of the monetisation and/or warrants proceeds could impact the progress of its underlying projects. DBL’s average monthly utilisation of its fund-based limits of INR2.33 billion was high at 86% for the 12 months ended December 2024, due to the slower recovery of receivables during 1HFY25. At end-September 2024, DBL had unencumbered cash and cash equivalents of about INR445.7 million (FYE24: INR226 million). The agency takes comfort from the demonstrated track record of its divestment of portfolio assets, which are nearing completion, as well as the presence of Shrem InvIT units valued at INR5.8 billion which are free from the lock-in period.  The release in working capital  in FY24 led to an improvement in the free cash flow as well as the net working capital cycle. DBL’s free cash flow from operations  turned positive at INR6,788 million at FYE24 (FYE23: negative INR78 million; FYE22: negative INR1,471 million)  The net working capital cycle improved to 109 days in FY24 (119;130).  Furthermore, the company does not have any major capex plan in the remainder of FY25 and FY26. As indicated by the management, the debt repayment at DBL Infra Assets Private Limited (DIAPL) shall be from InvIT units held by DIAPL. Any support from DBL to DIAPL is likely to affect the liquidity profile the company, and hence, is a key rating monitorable. Rating Sensitivities Positive: Sustaining of profitability levels while improving the order book visibility and maintaining adequate  liquidity, resulting in the interest coverage exceeding 2.25x and TOL/EBITDA remaining below 6.5x, all on a sustained basis, would result in a positive rating action. Negative: Any delay in the receipt of monetisation proceeds from asset sale activities or lower profitability or a longer working capital cycle or decline in revenue visibility, resulting in interest coverage remaining below 2.25x and/or TOL/EBITDA exceeding 6.5x, on a sustained basis , would result in the Outlook being revised to Stable .

Rationale and key rating drivers
CARE Ratings Ltd. had, vide its press release dated January 11, 2024, placed the rating(s) of Prakash Steelage Limited (PSL)
under the ‘issuer non-cooperating’ category as PSL had failed to provide information for monitoring of the rating as agreed to in
its Rating Agreement. PSL continues to be non-cooperative despite repeated requests for submission of information through e-
mails dated November 26, 2024, December 06, 2024, December 16, 2024 among others.
In line with the extant SEBI guidelines, CARE Ratings Ltd. has reviewed the rating on the basis of the best available information
which however, in CARE Ratings Ltd.’s opinion is not sufficient to arrive at a fair rating.
Users of this rating (including investors, lenders and the public at large) are hence requested to exercise caution
while using the above rating(s).

Press Release
Moksh Ornaments Limited
January 03, 2025
Facilities/Instruments Amount (₹ crore) Rating1 Rating Action
55.00
Long Term Bank Facilities CARE BBB-; Stable Reaffirmed
(Enhanced from 41.88)
Short Term Bank Facilities 0.72 CARE A3 Reaffirmed
Long Term Bank Facilities - - Withdrawn
Details of instruments/facilities in Annexure-1.
Rationale and key rating drivers
The ratings assigned to the bank facilities of Moksh Ornaments Limited (MOL) continue to derive strength from the
extensive experience of the promoters in Gems and Jewellery (G&J) industry with long track record of operations,
MOL’s established market position in gold jewellery industry, well-established and diversified customer base. The
ratings are also supported by comfortable capital structure and debt coverage indicators.
The above rating strengths, however, continue to be tempered by moderate scale of operations, low profitability
margins, profit margins susceptible to foreign currency fluctuation/volatility in raw material prices and strong
competition from organized and unorganized players in the industry.
Also, Care Ratings has withdrawn the outstanding ratings of ‘CARE BBB-; Stable’ assigned to the Bharat Co-operative
Bank facilities of Moksh Ornaments Limited with immediate effect. The above action has been taken at the request
of Moksh Ornaments Limited and ‘No Dues Certificate’ received from the bank that have extended the facilities rated
by CARE Ratings.
Rating sensitivities: Factors likely to lead to rating actions
Positive factors
• Increase in the scale of operations with total operating income close to around Rs. 600 crores on a sustained
basis.
• Improvement in profit margins with PBILDT exceeding 3.50% on a sustained basis.
• Improvement in Total Debt / Gross Cash Accruals to reach below 4.00x on a sustained basis.
Negative factors
• Deterioration in working capital cycle beyond 100 days on a sustained basis.
• Deterioration in the capital structure with overall gearing exceeding unity level on a sustained basis.
• Significantly lower than envisaged turnover and profitability margins leading to deterioration in cash accruals.
• Deterioration in the liquidity position with average utilization of the working capital limit exceeding 85% with
elongation in collection period exceeding 90 days on a sustained basis resulting in deterioration in overall
operating cycle.
Analytical approach: Standalone
Outlook: Stable
MOL is expected to benefit over the medium term from the stable industry outlook for gold jewellery in domestic
market.
Detailed description of the key rating drivers
Key strengths
Experienced management and established market position in Gold Jewellery Industry
The company is promoted by Mr. Jawanmal M. Shah and Mr. Amrit J. Shah having experience of over two decades
in the Jewellery industry. This has helped to develop strong and elongated relationships with customers as well as
suppliers which ensure smooth functioning day-to-day business.
1Complete definition of ratings assigned are available at www.careedge.in and other CARE Ratings Limited’s publications.
1 CARE Ratings Ltd.
Press Release
Well established and diversified customer base
MOL caters to customers based largely in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh and gets gold jewellery like bangles etc.
manufactured from artisans based in Kolkata and vertical chains in Mumbai. The company is a B2B player and
supplies manufactured products to various retailers. The company does export as well as domestic sales wherein
export sales contributed to 24.78% of the total revenue in FY24 vis-à-vis 17.33% of the total revenue in FY23 with
100% export sales to UAE, whereas the rest constituted domestic sales. MOL has long established relationship with
its clients and the sales are largely to the regular customers indicating repeated orders. In FY24, top 5 customers
accounted for nearly 40.28% of TOI and 34.13% in H1FY24 of the overall revenues indicating that the customer
base is well diversified.
Comfortable capital structure and debt coverage indicators
The capital structure of the company stood comfortable with overall gearing at 0.86x as on March 31, 2024 vis-à-vis
0.54x as on March 31, 2023. Backed by higher debt position as on balance sheet date, the debt protection metrics
viz. total debt to GCA remained at 7.42x as on Mar 31, 2024 vis-à-vis 4.42x as on Mar 31, 2023. Interest coverage
stood comfortable at 2.57x in FY24 vis-à-vis 4.76x in FY23.
Moderate operating cycle albeit operations being working capital intensive
MOL’s working capital cycle days remained moderate and has increased from 48 days in FY23 to 69 days in FY24
owing to increased inventory days. The inventory days Stood at 41 days in FY24 vis-à-vis 24 days in FY23. However,
in absolute terms, the same has increased significantly. The collection days has remained stable at 28 days in FY24
from 24 days in FY23. MOL procures gold on advance basis from registered dealers and banks. Average working
capital utilisation of fund-based facilities of MOL remained ~88% during past twelve months ending October 2024.
Key weaknesses
Growth in scale of operation however stood moderate along with modest profitability
The scale of operations of the company marked by Total operating income (TOI) of Rs. 450.32 crore in FY24 vis-à-
vis Rs. 446.84 crore in FY23. Further, MOL has reported sales of Rs. 295.27 crore in H1FY24 (Apr 2024 to Sept 2024)
vis-à-vis Rs. 259.24 crore in H1FY24 (April 2023 to Sept 2023). The PBILDT margin of the company has increased
to 3.01% in FY24 vis-à-vis 2.34% in FY23. The margins are modest due to limited value addition whereby the
manufacturing activity is outsourced to third parties. The PBILDT and PAT margin stood at 2.98% and 1.57%
respectively in H1FY25.
Exposed to volatility in foreign exchange fluctuation/raw material prices
MOL continues to derive 24.78% revenue from export sales so operational performance of the company is exposed
to foreign exchange fluctuation risk. Recently, the company has begun importing gold from the UAE, benefiting from
a 1% tariff concession under the Tariff Rate Quota (TRQ) and providing the benefit of natural hedge. However, MOL
has availed forward cover limit from the banks to hedge its risk on foreign currency exposure. The margins of MOL
are susceptible to volatility in gold prices which depend on the international commodity market as well as the forex
fluctuations. The company had reported profits on account of exchange rate fluctuations amounting to Rs. 1.12 crore
in FY24 vis-à-vis Rs. 0.25 crore during FY23.
Presence in highly competitive and fragmented Gems & Jewellery industry
The Gems & Jewellery (G&J) industry is a highly fragmented industry with a high level of competition from both the
organized and largely unorganized sector. Moreover, the global macroeconomic environment continues to remain
uncertain and poses a major challenge for the G&J industry, which is mainly export-driven. Furthermore, in the wake
of the recent adverse global macroeconomic developments, the G&J industry has seen a slowdown in demand and
the players have to offer high credit period to its customers.
Liquidity: Adequate
Liquidity is adequate marked by gross cash accruals expected in the range of Rs. 8-9 crore during FY25 and FY26
against principal term loan repayment obligation of Rs. 2.89 crore in FY25. The utilization of fund-based limits was
around 88% for the past 12 months ending October 2024. The company has free cash and bank balance of Rs. 1.82
crore as on March 31, 2024, vis-à-vis Rs. 3.10 crore as on March 31, 2023. Also, cash flow from operating activities
remained negative at Rs. 13.38 crore in FY24 vis-à-vis negative cash flow operations at Rs. 19.33 crore in FY23.
Further, current ratio and quick ratio remained comfortable at 2.23x and 1.09x as on Mar 31, 2024, vis-à-vis 3.16x
and 1.42x respectively as on Mar 31, 2023.

available/ limited information on the issuers’ performance. Accordingly the lenders, investors and other market
participants are advised to exercise appropriate caution while using this rating as the rating may not adequately reflect
the credit risk profile of the entity.

Total 201.75 201.75
*Instrument details are provided in Annexure-I
Rationale
The revision in outlook of Paras Defence & Space Technologies Limited (PDSTL) to Stable from Negative reflects the
improvement and the expected sustenance in its operating margins, working capital intensity and the consequent
improvement in its liquidity position. The operating margins increased to 27.5% at a consolidated level in H1 FY2025 due to
change in revenue mix towards relatively higher profitable products/segments. The working capital intensity decreased in H1
FY2025 (NWC/OI at 93.6%, FY2024: 111.0%) with decline in debtor days and delivery of periscopes resulting in reduced
inventory days. This, coupled with the receipt of QIP proceeds of ~Rs. 135 crore in October 2024, supported the company’s
liquidity position with unencumbered cash balance improving to ~Rs. 62 crore as on October 31, 2024 (against ~Rs. 3.0 crore
as on March 31, 2024), with nil fund-based utilisation as on October 31, 2024.
The ratings favourably factor in the healthy and improved order book (OB) of Rs. 850 crore as on September 30, 2024, which
translates to a comfortable OB/Operating Income (OB/OI) ratio of 3.35 times (FY2024: 2.49 times) of FY2024 OI, thus providing
medium-term revenue visibility. The ratings positively consider the company’s low leverage with TOL/TNW of 0.5 times as on
September 30, 2024 (FY2024: 0.4 times). The interest coverage improved to 11.5 times in H1 FY2025 (FY2024: 6.8 times) due
to reduced dependence on external borrowings to fund its working capital. The ratings draw comfort from the extensive
experience of the management team with more than three decades of experience in designing, developing, and manufacturing
a wide range of engineering products and solutions for the defence and space sector in the domain of optics, heavy engineering
and electronics. PDSTL’s long presence in the defence and space sector has helped it to establish strong relationships with its
customers as well as suppliers. The company has developed a strong management and execution team comprising several ex-
employees of Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) and Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), among others.
The ratings, however, remain constrained by the company’s working capital-intensive nature of operations, which despite
posting a downward trend recently, continues to remain high on an absolute basis on account of long receivables cycle and
high inventory holding period. This is attributable to stocking of critical raw materials to avoid any disruption in the delivery
schedules and high work in progress due to an elongated manufacturing cycle. The ratings are constrained by PDSTL’s
moderate scale of operations, coupled with client concentration risk, with top three clients contributing to 76% of the total
OB as on September 30, 2024. The Government’s thrust on ‘Make in India’ in the defence sector and the strong credit profile
of its principal customers augur well for PDSTL. PDSTL’s client profile mostly comprises Government organisations with
sustained repeat orders, largely mitigating the counterparty credit risk. Going forward, the company’s ability to prudently
manage its working capital intensity, while scaling up its revenues, with sustenance of its healthy operating margins, will be a
key rating monitorable.

Key rating drivers and their description
Credit strengths
Healthy OB provides medium-term revenue visibility – The company’s fresh order inflows over the past four fiscals remained
adequate, with orders worth ~Rs. 881 crore added in the last 18 months ending September 30, 2024. The pending OB of Rs.
850.0 crore as on September 30, 2024 (OB/OI ratio of 3.35 times of the OI in FY2024) provides medium-term revenue visibility.
Comfortable capital structure and healthy coverage indicators – The company’s capital structure remains comfortable with
TOL/TNW of 0.4 times as on September 30, 2024, supported by healthy accretion to reserves, coupled with equity infusion in
the past and low debt levels. The interest coverage improved to 11.5 times in H1 FY2025 (FY2024: 6.8 times) due to the reduced
dependence on external borrowings to fund its working capital. Going forward, ICRA expects the coverage indicators to remain
comfortable, benefitting from the scale-up in operations, given the strong order pipeline.
Extensive experience of management team – PDSTL’s promoters have more than three decades of experience in designing,
developing and manufacturing a wide range of engineering products and solutions for the defence and space sector in the
domain of optics, heavy engineering and electronics. Its long presence in the defence and space sector has helped to establish
strong relationships with its customers as well as suppliers. It has developed a strong management and execution team
comprising several ex-employees of BEL and DRDO, among others.
Credit challenges
Working capital-intensive nature of operations – The business is working capital intensive in nature with NWC/OI of 111.0%
and 93.6% in FY2024 and H1 FY2025, respectively, owing to the high inventory holding period and long receivables cycle. The
inventory levels are high because of additional stocking of critical raw materials to avoid any disruption in delivery schedules
and high work-in-progress due to elongated manufacturing cycle. However, the working capital intensity improved in H1
FY2025 on account of reduction in debtor days and delivery of periscopes resulting in reduced inventory days. PDSTL has been
able to manage its working capital cycle through extended credit period by its suppliers and availing mobilisation advance for
part orders.
Moderate scale of operations – While the company reported a robust YoY revenue growth of 14% and 56% in FY2024 and H1
FY2025, respectively, supported by healthy OB position and timely execution of orders, the scale of operations still remains
moderate. Given the Government’s thrust on ‘Make in India’ in the defence sector, PDSTL has been mainly catering to domestic
demand (~85% of OI contributed by domestic orders). Driven by the healthy OB status, ICRA expects the company to sustain
its revenue growth in FY2025 and FY2026.
High customer concentration risk, though largely mitigated by reputed customer base and repeat orders – The company
faces client concentration risk with top three clients contributing to 76% of the total OB as on September 30, 2024 and top five
clients accounting for ~54% of the revenue in FY2024. The client profile mostly comprises government organisations with
repeat orders received over the years, largely mitigating the counterparty credit risk. A major part of PDSTL’s clientele included
reputed government organisations, namely Laboratory for Electro-Optics Systems (a unit of ISRO), BEL, Instruments Research
and Development Establishment (a unit of DRDO) and private companies like RRP S4E Innovation Private Limited and Unifab
Engineering Project Private Limited. The company has long-standing relationships with most of its clientele. PDSTL also exports
to companies based in Israel, Singapore and USA.
Environment and social risks
Environmental considerations – PDSTL is operating in the defence equipment manufacturing industry, which requires various
raw materials and also entails sizeable energy and water requirements for running its multiple facilities. To safeguard the
environment against the impact of its operations, and possible regulatory action for violation of applicable environmental laws,
www.icra .in 2
Page |
the company has tied up with State Pollution Control Board authorities for appropriately disposing/recycling solid hazardous
waste at its manufacturing sites.
Social considerations – PDSTL is dependent on human capital and hence, retaining talent, maintaining healthy employee
relations, as well as supplier ecosystem remains essential for disruption-free operations. Going forward, the company’s ability
to manage risks related to safety in the areas of process, and occupational health, while developing safety leadership
capabilities, will remain a key factor from the social consideration perspective.
Liquidity position: Adequate
PDSTL has adequate liquidity, with an unencumbered cash and bank balance of ~Rs. 62 crore as on October 31, 2024. Further,
it had no long-term debt as on October 31, 2024. The average working capital utilisation during the 12-month period that
ended on September 30, 2024 remained at 69% for fund-based limits, with adequate cushion available in non-fund based limits
(utilisation being ~80%).
Rating sensitivities
Positive factors – ICRA could upgrade the ratings if the company demonstrates a significant growth in its overall scale of
operations, along with an improvement in its working capital cycle, while maintaining its operating profitability and sustaining
its liquidity position.
Negative factors – Pressure on PDSTL’s ratings could arise if lower-than-anticipated billing or a deterioration in the operating
profitability or working capital cycle impacts the company’s liquidity position and coverage metrics on a sustained basis.

Note on Complexity Levels of the Rated Instrument
In order to inform the investors about complexity of instruments, Acuité has categorized such
instruments in three levels: Simple, Complex and Highly Complex. Acuite’ s categorisation of
the instruments across the three categories is based on factors like variability of the returns to
the investors, uncertainty in cash flow patterns, number of counterparties and general
understanding of the instrument by the market. It has to be understood that complexity is
different from credit risk and even an instrument categorized as 'Simple' can carry high levels
of risk. For more details, please refer Rating Criteria “Complexity Level Of Financial
Instruments” on www.acuite.in.

sheet, Key Information document, General Information document are yet ot be
finalised.BWR notes that the company has strategic partnership with various developers. PVP
Ventures Limited has tied up with reputed developers like Casa Builders Private Limited,
Rainbow Foundations Limited and Brigade Enterprises Limited for executing various
projects.
The Ratings factors in early stage construction and demand risk of the project and
dependence on the JDA partner. The project is scheduled to be launched in Mid- September
2025. The ratings are supported by the favourable location and a reasonably demonstrated
execution track record of the JDA partner as well as strong cashflow coverage and escrow
mechanism together with initial moratorium period which affords flexibility to service the
proposed NCD. Additionally, BWR notes that the company has concluded the OTS of the
previously rated NCD’s and is in pursuit of new business lines and is in the process of
streamlining its intercompany transactions with other group companies.

KEY RATING DRIVERS
Rating strengths-:
Demonstrated monetising track record of strategically located land parcel ; strong JDA
partner for future projects : PVP Ventures Limited has an established track record of over
decades in the Chennai region through Joint Development agreements (JDAs) and has
monetised its land bank through delivery of 23 Lsf of residential real estate projects in the
past along with Real estate developers. The 70 acre land parcel is located strategically and
has a well developed surrounding infrastructure which also has a completed project named
North town, where 2000 families are already living and project rainbow which is more than
90% complete and awaiting completion certificate. PVP has entered into a JDA with CASA
Builders Private Limited to monetise 12 acres of land and further plans to execute a JV with
Brigade on the remaining land parcel
Proposed debt secured through ring-fenced and escrowed cash flow from new project
Mercury: Mercury Project is a part of JDA with Casa Builder Private Limited. The
company has an upcoming project, Mercury, along with co-developer Casa Builder Private
Limited, which is a Joint development agreement between PVP Ventures and Casa Builder
Private Limited in the ratio of 40 to 60%, respectively. The project in total has total saleable
area of 31,29,552 square feet(1678 units) and total cashflow potential of Rs 560 Crs for PVP
Ventures Limited. The company is expected to have an escrow mechanism in place for debt
servicing of proposed NCD repayment of Rs 150 Crs, wherein cashflow of Mercury project
is expected to be escrowed with investor LIC. The Company is expected to have average
DSCR of 2.75 as repayment will take place until FY29, and as repayment schedule as per
proposed debenture trustee deed is structured over four years until FY 29 with one year of
moratorium for installment and coupon in arrears. The company is likely to launch the project
in H1FY25. The company is expected to have average cash coverage ratio of 1.35x for FY
25-30.
Additional comfort is derived from cashflows of rainbow project which has unsold inventory
of 292 units both for PVP Ventures Limited and Rainbow Foundations Limited and advances
of Rs 40 Crs is realized from sold inventory of 176 units with no major operational cost for
PVP Ventures Limited and total cash flow potential of Rs 107 Crs for PVP Ventures Limited.
Rating weakness-:
Project execution and market risk in the upcoming and recently launched projects: The
project Mercury is although launched recently with developer share, it is still in the nascent
3
stage of execution and is expected to be completed in Nov 2025 as per RERA timelines,
exposing it to project execution/completion and time over-run risk along with sale/marketing
risk. Any decline in demand may adversely impact its cash flow position, considering the
project life cycle. Also, since the company has launched the project rainbow in June 2023,
and project is expected to be completed by May 2025 as per RERA timelines, leading to sale
/marketing risk for the same. BWR also notes that as per key terms of Joint development
agreement PVP Ventures Limited is dependent on Casa Builders Private Limited to sell its
inventory position exposing it to competition in industry in close vicinity.
Expected increase in leverage levels; debt-funded investments expected to remain high
in near term: The company’s debt levels are expected to increase moderately and are
expected to be in the range of 0.25x on average in FY 25-27 primarily to fund the
Investments/acquisitions and for reimbursement to the company for expenses incurred toward
transaction costs and for project land acquisition for project Mercury. However, this risk is
mitigated since the company is expected to realize healthy cash flow from operations in
FY25-27 from project Mercury and project Rainbow, which is expected to result in
repayment of debt in FY 27-29. However, any considerable delay in project launches for the
upcoming project or reduction in sales velocity in such launches could exert pressure on its
debt protection metrics. Moreover since company has extended loans and advances to group
companies (NCCPL) to tune of Rs 240 Crs (as on 31 March 2025) for acquisition of land
which are currently provided as security to ED and SEBI, company ‘s gearing position
(analysed ) is not meaningful until FY25 and is expected to be around 1.34 x on average for
FY26-27 .
Cyclicality in the real estate sector- The real estate sector is marked by volatile
prices and a highly fragmented market structure because of many regional players. In
addition, being a cyclical industry, the real estate sector is highly dependent on macro -
economic factors that render the company’s sales vulnerable to any downturn in demand. Any
new specific approvals on environment, social, regulatory is expected to hit the project as the
project duration is four years. However the real estate industry is already covered under
RERA act and the act in on place from 2016 onwards. Company has already obtained RERA
approvals for the project and does not see major regulatory challenges.
ANALYTICAL APPROACH AND APPLICABLE RATING CRITERIA: BWR has
applied a standalone approach as the project cash flows from this project are ringfenced.
RATING SENSITIVITIES
Positive factors: A positive rating action may result, if the company is able to launch its
project as per scheduled timelines and significantly improve its sales and collections in over
medium term post launch, while maintaining Gearing (analysed)<1 over medium term
Negative factors: A Negative rating action may result , if the company is not able to launch
project as per schedule and generate significant sales in medium term post launch, and/or
considerable debt-funded investments in new projects or acquisitions resulting in weakening
of Gearing analysed and liquidity position ,on a sustained basis.
4
LIQUIDITY INDICATORS(Adequate): PVP had cash and cash equivalents of Rs 2.28 Crs
in FY24 at standalone level. The company has no external debt as on 31 March 2024 and 9M
FY25 resulting in nil debt obligations as on date. The company has planned to avail Rs 150
Crs of proposed NCD’s which is expected to be paid FY26-29, however coupon interest is
expected to be repaid after moratorium period of one year from availment over quarters.
ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR PROVISIONAL RATINGS:
The provisional rating is contingent upon completion of pending steps and execution of the
following documents:
(Finalization of Debenture trustee deed, Term sheet , Key Information document, General
information document)
The provisional rating shall be converted into a final rating following receipt of confirmation
of completion of pending steps and/or executed transaction documents, as applicable, within
90 days from the date of issuance of the debt instrument/availment of borrowings (as
applicable). The final rating assigned shall be consistent with the completed actions and/or
available documents at the end of the validity period. In case of non-receipt of the duly
executed transaction documents within the above-mentioned timeline, BWR may either grant
an extension of upto another 90 days based on the status of the pending steps/documentation
or take appropriate action in line with its policy on provisional ratings and applicable
regulatory guidelines.
RATING THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED IN THE ABSENCE OF
PENDING STEPS / DOCUMENTATIONS
In the absence of pending steps/documentation considered while assigning provisional rating
as mentioned above, BWR would have assigned a rating of ‘BWR BB(Stable). While
arriving at the ratings, BWR has also factored in certain terms and conditions of the
transaction. In case the debt is raised and there are material changes in the terms of the
transaction, BWR may review the rating on the basis of the revised terms of the transaction in
accordance with its provisional ratings policy.
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROVISIONAL NATURE OF CREDIT RATING
The Provisional rating indicates that the rating is contingent upon completion of the critical
pending steps and/or execution of pending documentation, as applicable. The final rating
may differ from the provisional rating in case the completed actions/executed documents are
not in conformity with those envisaged initially at the time of assignment of rating. In such
circumstances, BWR may take appropriate action which may include a rating change, outlook
change, placing the rating on Rating watch etc, depending on the status of the transaction, in
line with BWR’s policy on provisional ratings. The rating of the debt instrument/borrowings
would have been different in the absence of the pending steps/documentation.

Press Release
AYM Syntex Limited
February 03, 2025
Facilities/Instruments Amount (₹ crore) Rating1 Rating Action
178.40
Long-term bank facilities CARE A; Stable Reaffirmed
(Reduced from 234.41)
Short-term bank facilities 385.00 CARE A1 Reaffirmed
Details of instruments/facilities in Annexure-1.
Rationale and key rating drivers
The reaffirmation of the ratings assigned to the bank facilities of AYM Syntex Limited (ASL) factors in the improvement in operating
performance of the company in H1FY25 after moderation witnessed in the company's operating performance in FY24 and FY23.
Performance for FY23 and FY24, was impacted by the sluggish demand coupled with the decline in margins due to lower
realisation, increase in cost of indigenously sourced materials and the product mix. The operating performance was further
impacted by a fire accident at the company’s plant in Rakholi, effecting a few machineries during Q1FY24 which impacted
performance for H1FY24. The company has restored the affected lines and with additional capacities in its Bulk Continuous
Filament (BCF) and Industrial Yarn (IDY) segment, with incremental capacity and improved demand from export market, along
with better product mix, the company operating performance is expected to improve by end of March 31, 2025. CARE Ratings
Limited (CARE Ratings) expects the operating margins to improve by end of FY25 led by increased capacities, product offerings
for newer/niche segments and better product mix along with process improvisation capex.
The capital structure of the company marked by overall gearing moderated to 1.14x as on March 31, 2024, from 0.94x as on
March 31, 2023, with increase in short term/working capital borrowings. The company in October 2024 has raised ₹141.76 crore
via preferential issue with the issue amount to be utilised towards repayment of debt (other than working capital),
repayment/reduction in working capital borrowings, general corporate purposes and capital expenditure. The capital structure of
the company is expected to improve by end of March 31, 2025, with increased capital base and reduction in debt. The total debt
to profit before interest, lease rentals, depreciation, and taxation (TD/PBILDT) of the company deteriorated to 5.37x as on March
31, 2024, due to increased debt and lower profitability due to fire in Q1FY24 but the same is expected to improve to less than 3x
by end of March 31, 2025, with improved profitability and reduced debt levels. The company plans to undertake capex in high
margin business for increasing its capacity in FY25 and FY26. To meet its capex plan, company shall utilise its preferential
proceeds, internal accruals and debt towards increase in capacities including maintenance capex.
The ratings continue to consider the strong promoter group and their demonstrated financial support, established clientele with
low customer concentration, and a geographically diversified revenue mix, with exports contributing 47.5% in FY24 (PY: 46.5%).
However, the ratings are constrained by the exposure to fluctuations in raw material prices and foreign exchange currency risk.
Additionally, any large debt-funded capex for the production-linked incentive (PLI) project under the subsidiary, which could
weaken ASL's financial risk profile, will remain a key monitorable.
Rating sensitivities: Factors likely to lead to rating actions
Positive factors
• Substantial improvement in the total operating income (TOI) along with sustainability of the profit before interest, lease

Press Release
CARE Ratings Limited (CARE Ratings) has considered the consolidated financials for arriving at the ratings owing to the operations
in similar business and business linkages that exists with its subsidiaries. ASL incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary, AYM Textile
Private Limited, on June 27, 2022. The list of companies that are consolidated to arrive at ratings are given in Annexure-6.
Outlook: Stable
The stable outlook reflects CARE Ratings’ expectations of improvement in the company’s operating and financial risk profiles amid
the healthy cash flow generation from operations.
Detailed description of key rating drivers
Key strengths
Experienced promoters and management with track record of support
Established in 1983, ASL was jointly promoted by BK Goenka and RR Mandawewala. In October 2015, post the spun off, the
stakes held by the erstwhile promoters and their various group companies were transferred to Rajesh Mandawewala, who is the
Vice Chairman of Welspun Living Limited and Co-promoter of the Welspun group. Mandawewala is the Promoter and Chairman
of ASL. The promoters of the company have infused around ₹95 crore into the company over FY17-FY24 to provide liquidity
support while executing capex in these years
Moderation in operating performance in FY24, expected improvement in FY25
In FY24, AYM Syntex Limited (ASL) saw a 7.8% decline in TOI to ₹1,346.8 crore from ₹1,461.38 crore in FY23. This decrease
was largely due to a fire incident in Q1FY24, which temporarily disrupted operations and led to a 0.52% year-over-year (y-o-y)
drop in sales volumes. Despite these challenges, the company managed to recover its losses in the second half of FY24. The
share of exports in total revenue increased to 47.5% in FY24 from 46.5% in the previous year, although export revenues were
slightly lower at ₹644.6 crore compared to ₹677.23 crore in FY23 due to operational disruptions and global uncertainties, such as
Red Sea shipping disruptions, and Middle East region unrest among others. Despite all this, the company has been able to expand
its customer base in European market and other countries.
The cost of materials decreased to 55.7% of revenue from 59.8% in FY23, due to efficiencies in buying, an improved sales mix,
and favourable movements in Brent crude prices during the year. Operating margins saw a slight decline from 6.84% in FY23 to
6.65% in FY24, but the company improved its PBILDT margin to 8.33% in H1FY25. Despite the initial setbacks, ASL expanded its
customer base in Europe and other regions, demonstrating resilience and adaptability in a challenging market environment. CARE
Ratings expects operating margins to improve by end of FY25 led by increased capacities, newer/niche segments and better
product mix and process improvisation capex.
Established clientele with low customer concentration
The company has an established clientele and caters customers such as Godfrey Hirst Australia Pty, and The Victoria Carpet
Company among many other prominent clients in various geographies. The company’s customer base is well distributed and there
is no substantial concentration of risk, as no single customer contributes over 10% of the revenue and of the outstanding
receivables. The revenue contribution in FY24 from the top five customers is 22% (PY: 22%), while that from the top 10 customers
is 33% (PY: 32%). Exports contributed to 47.5% of the TOI in FY24 (PY: 46.5%).
Healthy working capital cycle
The company’s working capital cycle continues to remain healthy at 33 days in FY23 and FY24 compared to 24 days in FY22.
ASL’s major raw materials are nylon and polyester chips. ~40-50% of the total raw material purchases are imported depending
upon the market and requirement, whereas the rest are sourced from the domestic market. For FY24, 41% of the procurement
is through local suppliers. Since over 70% business is make-to-order, the inventory stocking period is less than a month. However,
overall operations are working capital intensive with high dependence on working capital borrowings with an average working
capital utilisation of 79% for the last 12 months ended December 31, 2024.
Expected improvement in financial risk profile
The financial risk profile and capital structure of AYM Syntex Limited (ASL) are expected to improve with the scheduled repayments
of long-term debt and an overall improvement in financial position. The total debt, including creditors on LC/acceptances,
increased from ₹392.96 crore as of March 31, 2023, to ₹480.90 crore in FY24, primarily due to higher working capital borrowings
and acceptances on account of fire incident in plant. This led to a deterioration in overall gearing (including LC acceptances) to
1.14x as on March 31, 2024, from 0.94x as on March 31, 2023. The term debt/gross cash accrual (GCA) improved to 3.24x (PY:
3.46x) due to regular long-term debt repayments, while the total debt/GCA deteriorated to 8.15x (PY: 6.26x) due to increased
working capital borrowings and acceptances.
2 CARE Ratings Ltd.
Press Release
Interest coverage ratios also deteriorated, with PBILDT interest coverage at 2.13x (PY: 2.78x) in FY24, mainly due to increased
finance costs from higher borrowings for capex and greater usage of working facilities. However, the company improved its
PBILDT margin to 8.33% in H1FY25 from 6.65% in FY24, leading to an improvement in the PBILDT interest coverage ratio to
2.56x from 2.13x in FY24.
The company in October 2024 has raised ₹141.76 crore through preferential issue with the issue amount to be utilised towards
repayment of debt (other than working capital), repayment/reduction in working capital borrowings, general corporate purpose
and capital expenditure. The company’s capital structure is expected to improve by end of March 31, 2025, with increased capital
base and reduction in debt. The company’s total debt/PBILDT deteriorated to 5.37x as on March 31, 2024, due to increased debt
and lower profitability due to fire in Q1FY24 affecting operations in H1, which is expected to improve to less than 3x by end of
March 31, 2025, with improved profitability and debt levels.
The company plans to undertake capex in high margin business for increasing its capacity in FY25 and FY26. To meet its capex
plan, company shall utilise its preferential proceeds, internal accruals and debt towards increase in capacities including
maintenance capex.
Key weaknesses
Loss by fire
On May 12, 2023, fire broke out at the company's plant in Rakholi, effecting a few machineries in one of the divisions. The
insurance claim is being submitted under two categories – material damage and fire loss of profit insurance (FLOP). ASL has
submitted an estimated material damage claim, which includes capex, civil, and stocks, among others and has received the claim
amount in full. However, FLOP Claim which is the second part of the overall claim is under process and realisation of this claim
will bring the additional inflow and could help to improve liquidity.
Input price fluctuation risk and currency risk
ASL’s major raw materials are polymer chips and partially oriented yarn (POY) or texturised yarn. These inputs are derivatives of
crude oil purified terephthalic acid (PTA) and mono ethylene glycol (MEG). The average PTA prices fell by 18.1%, while the
average MEG prices increased by 9.3% in December FY24 against December FY23. The cost pressures have eased; the PTA and
MEG prices eased to ₹70.2/kg and ₹61.8/kg in December 2024 from their peaks in July 2022 and April 2022, respectively. Any
adverse movements in the prices of raw materials may put pressure on ASL’s profitability margins, in case the rise in price cannot
be recovered entirely through higher realisations. ASL’s focus on high-value and specialty products and location advantage (being
present in a textile manufacturing hub) mitigates the pricing risk and competition pressure to an extent. In some cases, depending
upon the customer requirements, the company works on formula-based pricing, wherein the prices are contractually binding for
a specific period and there is scope for transferring the increased cost and vice versa.
As for currency risk, ASL is naturally hedged on account of exports. The company’s raw material requirements are met from
domestic suppliers such as Reliance, JBF, and Indorama among others, and imports from countries such as Taiwan, Korea, and
China among others. In FY24 exports accounted for 48% of TOI (PY: 47%). ASL made a forex gain of ₹0.64 crore in FY24 against
a gain of ₹3.59 crore in FY23.
Liquidity: Adequate
The company’s liquidity remains adequate, marked by GCA of ₹38.20 crore in H1FY25 and cash and cash equivalents of ₹3.57
crore as on September 30, 2024. The company has an average fund-based and non-fund-based utilisation of 79% for the last 12
months ending December 31, 2024. Against this, the company has scheduled repayments of ₹63.75 crore (including lease liabilities
of ₹6.03 crore) in FY24. The company is undertaking capex of ₹160-165 crore in FY25 and FY26 towards increase in capacities
including maintenance capex to be funded through term loan of ₹65 crore and balance internal accruals.

RATING ACTION / OUTLOOK / NATURE OF NON-COOPERATION The Bank Loans of BSL Ltd. (or "the company") were last rated at BWR BBB-/Stable and BWR A3, downgraded and migrated to the ISSUER NOT COOPERATING Category on November 22, 2023. The bank loan ratings of the company are now due for review in May 2024 in compliance with extant regulatory guidelines. BWR has followed up with the company to provide the required information and cooperation for the review of the ratings, which the company has not provided, and despite repeated requests by BWR, the company’s management has remained non-cooperative. Further, the company has not been submitting the monthly “No Default Statement” (NDS) for more than three months. The company has also taken up with BWR for withdrawal of the bank loan ratings, however, the company has not complied with the BWR’s Rating Withdrawal Policy despite repeated requests. As the ratings of the company have been under the INC category for more than six months, accordingly, in compliance with the extant regulatory guidelines, BWR has downgraded the ratings of the company from BWR BBB-/Stable and BWR A3, INC to BWR BB+/Stable and BWR A4+, continues to be in the ISSUER NOT COOPERATING* category. *Issuer did not cooperate; based on best available information. The lenders/investors may note to exercise due caution while using the above rating which mentions "Issuer Not Cooperating" since the rating lacks any projections or forward-looking component as it is arrived at based on the best available information without any management/banker's interaction. LIMITATIONS OF THE RATING Information availability risk is a key factor in the assessment of credit risk as generally, non-cooperation by the rated entities to provide the required information for a review of the assigned rating may also be accompanied by financial stress. Users of the credit rating should, therefore, take into account the possible deterioration in the credit quality of the rated entity arising from its non-transparency and withholding of the information required for a review of the rating.

The rating action also factors the company’s various initiatives to augment its business profile through acquisitions and providing a wider offering with the on-going modernisation and upgradation of its Tumkur facility. The rating strengths remain constrained by the moderation in financial risk profile, its exposure to intense industry competition with moderate scale of operations and technological obsolescence. The ‘Stable’ outlook indicates a low likelihood of rating change over the medium term. BWR believes TVSE’s business risk profile will be maintained over the medium term. The outlook may be revised to Positive if a sustained increase in the scale of operations with improvement in the profitability results in an improved financial risk profile with stabilisation of new products lines and services, thereby strengthening the business profile. The outlook may be revised to Negative with lower-than-expected revenue/cash accruals or a deterioration in the profitability/gearing indicators and/or a significant increase in the operating cycle, and/or a deterioration in the capital structure due to fresh debt-financed capital expenditure, thus weakening the company’s financial risk profile. KEY RATING DRIVERS Credit Strengths: Experienced management and established market position: :TVSE has an operational track record of over three decades and has been a part of the TVS group, an established and reputed business group. The company has an experienced and professional management team, having the robust internal control and risk management systems of the company is in a position to mitigate possible risks on price movements and technological obsolescence. TVSE has demonstrated the management's agility and awareness through the addition of new products that are in demand. The company continue to explore fresh opportunities. Long-term agreements with reputed brands: :The company has entered into long-term agreements with reputed clientele such as Dell, HP, Fiserv for their various product lines. The company also has lifestyle portfolio from Harman, a reputed clientele. Stable performance of the product and customer service segments, supported by business plans and initiatives: :The company operates in two revenue segments: the Products and Solutions segment and the Customer Support Services segment. The share of the Products and Solutions segment in the topline remained stable at 73% in FY24, up from 70% in the previous year. Revenue from this segment grew by 8.67% year-on-year, while revenue from the Customer Support Services segment declined by 8.15% year-on-year. With a shift towards B2B services, including CMS, EMS, and IMS, the company expects greater revenue contribution from the B2B services segment moving forward. Additionally, the company has completed an acquisition, expanding its capabilities to offer a comprehensive range of solutions, including hardware, applications, digital payment solutions, and cloud computing software to sectors like retail, banking, and government. The company has also invested in M/S Swiftomatics Services Private Limited (Royal Pos) by subscribing to 2,000 optionally convertible and redeemable preference shares. Royal Pos provides end-to-end SaaS-based applications to retail merchants and restaurants, aiming to digitalize and automate operations for small and medium-sized enterprises. The company has integrated its Point of Sale products to offer efficient billing solutions to its customers. Credit Risks: Moderation in Financial Risk Profile: :The company achieved operating revenue of Rs. 366.04 Crores during FY24, compared to Rs. 353.49 Crores in FY23, reflecting a year-on-year growth of 4%. The company recorded an EBITDA of Rs. 9.63 Crores in FY24, down from Rs. 19.70 Crores in FY23. The decline in profitability was primarily due to an increase in employee benefit expenses on a year-on-year basis, as well as an overall increase in operational costs. The operating profit margin stood at 2.63% in FY24, compared to 5.60% in FY23, while the net profit margin decreased to 0.07% in FY24, down from 2.69% in FY23. Furthermore, the total debt to tangible net worth (TNW) ratio and total outstanding liabilities to TNW ratio declined from 0.11 times and 1.44 times, respectively, as of March 31, 2023, to 0.46 times and 1.80 times, respectively, as of March 31, 2024. Despite the increase in these ratios, they remain at a comfortable level. Debt protection metrics, as indicated by the Interest Coverage Ratio (ISCR) and Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR), decreased to 4.91 times and 4.61 times, respectively, as of March 31, 2024, compared to 14.44 times and 13.13 times, respectively, as of March 31, 2023. This decline is attributed to the increase in finance costs, higher operational expenses, and a reduction in EBITDA. In H1FY25, the company has achieved an operating revenue of Rs.215.88 Crores, EBITDA of Rs. 7.15 Crores and Net loss of Rs. 2.58 Crores. Intense competition and moderate scale of operations : :The company operates in an intensely competitive and fragmented electronics industry. The company's moderate scale of operations are vulnerable to a certain extent to the periodic, regular renewal of its agreements with various clients. However, TVSE benefits on account of its strong brand presence and long-term relation with reputed clients. Exposure to technological obsolescence: :The company deals in technology-related products and services, which requires frequent upgradation and calls for additional investment. ANALYTICAL APPROACH For arriving at its ratings, Brickwork Ratings has adopted a standalone approach and applied its rating methodology as detailed in the Rating criteria below. The Company do not have any subsidiary Company as on March 31, 2024. RATING SENSITIVITIES The company's ability to improve its revenue and profitability through the consolidation of factories and strengthen its business profile would be key rating sensitivities. Upward: Substantial growth in revenue and profitability, strengthening the financial risk profile. Stabilisation of new product lines with an increased scale of operations resulting in higher contribution to revenue and profitability on a sustained basis. Downward: Deterioration in key credit metrics owing to pressure on operating profits due to competition, sharp rise in receivables levels, or fresh capex. LIQUIDITY INDICATORS - Adequate The company’s liquidity position remains adequate, as evidenced by the moderate utilization of its fund-based working capital limits, which stood at approximately ~20% for the trailing 12 months ending November 2024. The company also maintains a current ratio above unity at 1.37 times as of March 31, 2024.

Rating Rationale Rating Rationale June 23, 2022 | Mumbai Digispice Technologies LimitedRatings reaffirmed and Withdrawn Rating ActionTotal Bank Loan Facilities RatedRs.45 CroreLong Term RatingCRISIL BB+/Stable (Rating reaffirmed and Withdrawn)Short Term RatingCRISIL A4+ (Rating reaffirmed and Withdrawn)1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities Detailed Rationale CRISIL Ratings has reaffirmed its rating on the bank facilities of Digispice Technologies Limited (DTL; part of the Spice group) at 'CRISIL BB+/Stable/CRISIL A4+' and simultaneously withdrawn the ratings at the request of the company and on receipt of a ‘no-objection certificate’ from the bankers. The withdrawal is in line with CRISIL Ratings’ policy on withdrawal of bank loan ratings. The reaffirmation reflects the continued revenue growth of the Spice group driven by significant growth in Spice Money Ltd (Spice Money; wholly owned subsidiary of DTL). Revenue of Spice Money grew 49% yoy to Rs 858 crore in fiscal 2022 compared with Rs 578 crore in fiscal 2021 driven by initiatives undertaken by the company like increase in Adhikari base. However, reported EBITDA remained flattish at Rs 22 crore for fiscal 2022 compared to Rs 21 crore for fiscal 2021 due to focus on transactions growth which is expected to continue going forward. Sustenance of growth in operating performance of Spice Money amid intense competition will be a key monitorable. Revenue of the digital services segment declined marginally to Rs 133 crore with reported EBITDA loss of Rs 8 crore for fiscal 2022 compared to Rs 134 crore and Rs 8 crore respectively in previous fiscal. Financial risk profile is marked by healthy unencumbered liquidity estimated at ~Rs 150 crore as on March 31, 2022. The ratings reflect the Spice group's healthy financial risk profile, significant growth in Spice Money and extensive experience of the promoters in the digital technology services sector. These strengths are partially offset by declining operating performance in Digital technology services segment and modest profitability. Analytical Approach CRISIL Ratings has combined the business and financial risk profiles of DTL and its direct subsidiaries and step-down subsidiaries, collectively referred to as the Spice group, because the entities have common management and strong cash flow fungibility. Please refer Annexure - List of Entities Consolidated, which captures the list of entities considered and their analytical treatment of consolidation. Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description Strengths: Significant growth in Spice Money: The group has strong focus on the entity, Spice Money, which entails providing banking and transactional services to remote locations in India. Revenue grew to Rs 858 crore in fiscal 2022 with reported EBITDA of Rs 22 crore, compared with Rs 578 crore and Rs 21 crore, respectively, in the the previous fiscal. The growth in revenue was aided by initiatives such as providing free hardware to retail agents, boosting Adhikari base to over 1 million touchpoints as well as increased adoption of digital payments. However, this industry has low barriers to entry leading to high competition. Further scaling up of the business and sustenance of revenue growth will be key monitorables. Healthy financial risk profile: Debt protection metrics were comfortable, reflected in healthy interest coverage ratio estimated above 25 times in fiscal 2022. Gearing was low, estimated at 0.22 times as on March 31, 2022 while networth was adequate at Rs 247 crore. The group has nil term debt obligation and maintains high cash and bank balance. The group had cash and bank balance of over Rs 150 crore on March 31, 2022. Capex and investment plans will remain moderate and therefore the financial risk profile should sustain going forward. Experience of the promoters and management team: The promoters have extensive experience in providing software/platform driven services, such as value-added services and SMS services, in the telecom domain. Apart from India, the group operates in Bangladesh, Singapore, Africa and South America. The company strengthened its management bandwidth by inducting a new chief executive officer to enter the software solutions space as part of its strategy to expand its digital technology services. Weaknesses: Decline in operating performance of the digital technology services segment: The share of digital technology services reduced to ~13% of the overall revenue in fiscal 2022 from 38% in fiscal 2021. Revenue of the digital services segment declined marginally to Rs 133 crore with reported EBITDA loss of Rs 8 crore for fiscal 2022 compared to Rs 134 crore and Rs 8 crore respectively in previous fiscal owing to weak environment, with de-growth of voice-based services by telecom operators, as well as intense competition. The company has been taking corrective action by adding consulting solutions as well as revamping its service offerings. However, the overall contribution of this segment to the group’s overall profitability is expected to remain low. Modest profitability: Though Spice Money has scaled up considerably, the overall profitability remained subdued because of decline in the digital technology services segment. The EBITDA margin stood at ~1.5% for the fiscal 2022 compared with ~1.8% in the previous fiscal. The group’s ability to improve operating profitability going forward will remain a key monitorable. Liquidity: Adequate Unencumbered cash and bank balance was estimated at Rs 167 crore as on March 31, 2022. Fund-based bank lines of Rs 15 crore were utilised moderately during the 12 months through March 2022. Expected cash accrual of Rs 25-35 crore per annum in fiscals 2022 and 2023 will sufficiently cover capex or incremental working capital requirement in the absence of debt obligation. Outlook: Stable CRISIL Ratings believes the group’s business risk profile will continue to be supported by the management’s experience and revenue growth in Spice Money. The financial risk profile will remain adequate over the medium term in the absence of any significant debt-funded capex. Rating Sensitivity factors Upward factors Increase in operating profitability, with the EBITDA margin sustaining above 6% Better revenue diversity while maintaining strong financial risk profile Downward factors Decline in revenue and low operating profitability below 2% Large, debt-funded capex or investment, weakening the capital structure About the Group The Spice group was founded by Mr B K Modi and is presently managed by his son, Mr Dilip Modi. The group operates in the value-added services segment through DTL. It has tie-ups with various telecom operators, and also operates in Bangladesh, Singapore, Africa and South America. It has started providing communication experience services, through analytical and campaign management tools, and consulting solutions to the telecom sector, insurance sector and governments. Recently, the group has entered the fintech space through Spice Money. Using its robust technology infrastructure, it provides financial services, enabling people to remit money to bank accounts in quick, convenient, and cost-effective manner, and value-added services such as air and railway tickets, hotel booking, mobile top-ups and bill payments from more than 500,000 touch points in India. The company has the necessary permissions and licenses such as PPI (pre-paid payment instruments), AEPS (Aadhaar-enabled payment system), BBPS (Bharat Bill Payment System), E-KYC (electronic know your customer) integration and UPI (united payment interface) to enable it to leverage upcoming fintech opportunities. In fiscal 2022, the Spice group (on consolidated basis) had operating income of Rs 990 crore and net profit of Rs 6.7 crore, against Rs 712 crore and net profit of Rs 5.6 crore, respectively, in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal.

Rationale and key rating drivers
The ratings assigned to the bank facilities and fixed deposit issue of Gillanders Arbuthnot & Co Limited (GACL) take into account
the improvement in financial performance in H1FY25 on y-o-y basis after witnessing decline in FY24 (refers to the period April 1
to March 31) which was already envisaged. The improvement in performance is backed by healthy profitability reported in the
tea division leading to significant improvement in the overall profitability of the company. Textile division continued to report
negative PBIT margin, largely owing to lower realisations amidst reduced demand, however in Q2FY25, the company has recorded
a positive PBIT. The engineering division (MICCO) recorded almost 127% y-o-y growth in revenue in H1FY25, though margins
recorded moderations owing to increase in expenses. However, with a healthy order book in hand, this segment is expected to
become a significant contributor to the overall revenue & profitability in the current fiscal. Apart from these three, the company
also generates rental income from leasing out the Gillander house and profitability from the same, continues to remain stable.
The ratings continue to derive strength from experienced promoters along with demonstrated fund support, diversified revenue
profile and satisfactory capital structure.
The ratings, however, continue to be constrained by the susceptibility of profitability to volatility in commodity prices & vagaries
of nature, working capital & labour-intensive operations and exposure to seasonal nature of industry and Government policy.
Rating sensitivities: Factors likely to lead to rating actions
Positive factors
• Increase in total operating income above Rs.400 crore with PBILDT margin above 7% on a sustained basis.
• Improvement in gross cash accruals (GCA) above Rs.30 crore on a sustained basis.
Negative factors
• Stretch in working capital cycle of the company beyond 150 days on a consistent basis.
• Deterioration in interest coverage ratio below 1.3x on a sustained basis.
Analytical approach: Standalone
Outlook: Stable
Stable outlook reflects that the entity is likely to benefit from its diversified revenue profile and sustain revenue and profitability
in the medium term.
Detailed description of key rating drivers
Key strengths
Experienced promoters along with demonstrated fund support: GACL was incorporated in 1935 and as such has a long
track record of operations. It was acquired by the Kolkata-based G.D. Kothari group in late 1960s. Mr. A. K. Kothari, Chairman, is
the son of Late Mr. G. D. Kothari, the founder of the group and has significant business experience. He along with Mr. Mahesh
Sodhani, MD and CEO, is managing the day-to-day affairs of the company. Apart from GACL, the group has business interest in
engineering products, healthcare, etc. through other group companies. GACL enjoys financial flexibility by virtue of it being part
of the G.D Kothari group, which will enable it to arrange for financing any shortfalls in accruals for servicing debt obligations, as
has been adequately demonstrated in the past.
Diversified business profile: GACL is a multi-divisional entity having presence in textiles, tea, engineering and leasing out of
property. The company earns majority of its revenue (~80%-90%) from tea and textile division. The engineering division
contributes revenue in the range of 7% to 12%, followed by leasing of property. During FY24, apart from the MICCO division,

Press Release
tea & textile divisions reported lower PBIT margins owing to lower demand and a dent on realisations, whilst the PBIT margins
for the property segment, recorded moderation owing to increase in expenses towards property maintenance, when compared
with FY23. In H1FY25, tea recorded PBIT margin of 18.83% as against 13.46% in H1FY24, whilst the other divisions recorded
moderations. Any significant impact on the profitability of tea or textiles, significantly impacts the overall profitability of the
company.
Modest performance in FY24 albeit y-o-y improvement in H1FY25: The company’s financial performance, as envisaged,
recorded a significant moderation in FY24, wherein the company reported a negative PBILDT margin of 0.31% as against 4.93%
in FY23. The total operating income also recorded significant degrowth from Rs 420.03 crore in FY23 to Rs 329.71 crore in FY24
due to dip in performance of its major divisions like Tea and Textile, which recorded a degrowth in revenue of around 17.57%
and 14.61%, respectively and reported lower PBIT margins. The deterioration led to the company reporting cash loss of Rs.6.34
crore in FY24. The cash loss and shortfall in repayment was met out of money realised from debtors.
The tea industry was impacted during FY24 owing to lower prices amidst demand slowdown, and rising input costs which made
a significant dent in the overall profitability of the tea companies. However, in H1FY25, the tea prices have recorded significant
jump, owing to decline in productions across tea estates, resulting from inclement weather conditions. This led to improvement
in the financial performance of GACL with company earning PBILDT margin of 11.82% in H1FY25 as compared to 9.55% in
H1FY24. Furthermore, revenue from MICCO division also witnessed growth in H1FY25 backed by execution of existing orders in
hand. As on October 31, 2024, the company had an order book of Rs.228 crore, execution of which would lead to higher revenue
and profitability for the company going forward.
Satisfactory capital structure: The overall gearing ratio stood improved from 0.39x as on March 31, 2023, to 0.35x as on
March 31, 2024. The total debt of the company reduced from Rs.300.92 crore as on March 31, 2020, to Rs 88.70 crore as on
March 31, 2024, funded out of the proceeds from sale of textile unit (Akbarpur) and Tengapani Tea Estate, sale of investments
along with generated accruals and reduction in debtor and inventory level. Going forward with no major capex planned, the
capital structure is expected to remain satisfactory. With company incurring cash loss in FY24, debt protection metrics witnessed
moderation in FY24. However, the same has improved in H1FY25 and is expected to improve further during the projected period.
Key weaknesses
Profitability susceptible to volatility in commodity prices & vagaries of nature: GACL generates around 90% of its gross
sales from sale of commodity products (such as yarn, tea). The prices of such products are volatile in nature as it is based on
global demand-supply fundamentals. The raw materials used for manufacturing of synthetic yarn are dependent on the prices of
crude oil prices which are highly volatile in nature. Furthermore, tea division profitability is exposed to vagaries of nature as the
productivity of the same is dependent upon weather conditions where the wages is fixed cost in nature. Accordingly, the overall
profitability of the company is susceptible to volatility in prices of commodity products.
Working capital intensive nature of operation: The operations of GACL are working capital intensive in nature owing to
high working capital required for the engineering division, wherein the company has its money stuck in the form of retention
which ranges between 10% to 15% of the billed amount and the same is released post completion of the construction, on a
milestone basis. The company also has to advance bank guarantees in the form of mobilisation advances, performance guarantees
and security deposits. The operating cycle in engineering division thus is characterised by higher collection days.
Furthermore, in textile, the company has to maintain inventories and provide credit to its customers entailing high requirement
of working capital. Accordingly, the overall operating cycle of the company has remained moderate in the past three years. The
operating cycle of the company remained high at 119 days in FY24 up from 112 days in FY23. The inventory for tea industry
being seasonal in nature varies from time to time depending upon the season of harvest and sowing.
Labour intensive nature of operation: GACL’s operation is labour intensive in nature due to high dependency on labour for
its textile and tea division. The nature of the tea industry makes it highly labour intensive.
Liquidity: Adequate
The liquidity profile of the company is adequate marked by company earning GCA of Rs.19.58 crores vis-à-vis debt repayment
obligation of Rs. 5.40 crores in H1FY25. With repayment of the fixed deposit obligation, the company is left with negligible
repayment obligations going ahead. In FY24, the company incurred cash loss of Rs.6.34 crore and had debt repayment obligation
of Rs.8.67 crore. The cash loss and shortfall in repayment was met out of money realised from debtors. The average utilization
of fund-based limit stood at around 63% during the last 12 months period ended October 2024, and the month end average
utilisation of non-fund-based bank lines stood at 86.87% for the last 12 months ending October 2024. The financial flexibility of
the company has improved with the reduction in debt leading to a better capital structure along sufficient cushion in working
capital limit.
Environment, social, and governance (ESG) risks
The company has taken steps for conservation of energy like conventional tube lights and vapour lamps which are being replaced
by the energy efficient LED lights and old motors are replaced with new ultra-high efficiency motors to save energy. The company
is undertaking timely replacements of power capacitor and equipment for achieving ideal power factor in the Tea Estates and
realigning the process to conserve energy and be energy efficient.

Rating Rationale Rating Rationale August 16, 2024 | Mumbai Indian Terrain Fashions LimitedRatings downgraded to 'CRISIL BBB-/Stable/CRISIL A3' Rating ActionTotal Bank Loan Facilities RatedRs.105 CroreLong Term RatingCRISIL BBB-/Stable (Downgraded from 'CRISIL BBB/Stable')Short Term RatingCRISIL A3 (Downgraded from 'CRISIL A3+')Note: None of the Directors on CRISIL Ratings Limited’s Board are members of rating committee and thus do not participate in discussion or assignment of any ratings. The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities Detailed Rationale CRISIL Ratings has downgraded its ratings on the bank facilities of Indian Terrain Fashions Limited (ITFL) to ‘CRISIL BBB-/Stable/CRISIL A3’ from 'CRISIL BBB/Stable/CRISIL A3+'. The rating downgrade reflects weakening of business and financial risk profile owing to slowdown in demand and closure of boys wear segment. In 2025 revenue and EBITDA (Earnings before interest tax depreciation) is expected to be substantially lower compared to previous fiscal. The company reported a revenue degrowth of over 25% in first quarter of current year as compared to same period of previous fiscal. EBITDA also declined drastically to negative 16.79 per cent as compared to 6.23% for same period of previous fiscal. This is mainly on account of lower fixed cost absorption due to closure of boys division, weaker demand and higher discounts offered. This is expected to result in weakening of financial risk profile with deterioration in debt protection metrics and lower net cash accruals. Company is currently undertaking measures to reduce overall fixed cost. The improvement in operating performance in the ensuing quarters and the resultant improvement in financial profile will remain a key rating monitorable. The rating also reflects ITFL's strong market position supported by extensive industry experience of the promoters and a comfortable financial profile. These strengths are partially offset by working capital intensive operations and vulnerability to changes in fashion trends and competition. Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description Strengths: Strong market position supported by extensive industry experience of the promoters: ITFL retails readymade garments for men, driven by its flagship brand, ‘Indian Terrain’, through its own stores, franchisees, multi-brand retail outlets and large format retail counters such as Shoppers Stop Ltd (CRISIL A+/Stable/CRISIL A1+) and Lifestyle International Pvt Ltd (CRISIL AA+/Stable/CRISIL A1+). The company has a wide presence across India, mostly dominated in southern region, with total stores count of 234 as of June 2024. EBO revenue (Exclusive Brand Outlet) contributes the highest to the total revenue at over 50 percent of the total revenue. Further, the promoters have an experience of over three decades in apparel retail industry. This has given them an understanding of the dynamics of the market and enabled them to establish relationships with suppliers and customers. Comfortable financial profile: ITFL’s capital structure have been at moderate healthy level due to limited reliance on external funds yielding gearing of 0.74 and total outside liabilities to adj tangible networth (TOL/ANW) of 1.57 for year ending on 31st March 2024. The interest coverage and net cash accrual to total debt (NCATD) ratio are at 1.59 times and 0.09 times for fiscal 2024. ITFL debt protection measures is expected to deteriorate in current fiscal on account of impact in operating performance. Improvement in debt protection metrics will remain a key monitorable. Weaknesses: Working capital intensive operations: Gross current assets were at 284 - 339 days over the three fiscals ended March 31, 2024. The extensive working capital requirement is reflected in gross current assets (GCA) of 326 days as on March 31, 2024. Its large working capital requirements arise from its high debtor due to its business with Large Format Stores (LFS) and e-commerce partners. Furthermore, due to its business need, it holds large work in process & inventory. Any sharp increase in working capital requirement that might impact on the liquidity of the company would remain key rating monitorable. Vulnerability to changes in fashion trends and competition: ITFL’s business is driven by fashion trends and its target segment's aspirations are significantly influenced by peers, role models, and the media. The operations also remain exposed to competition from a number of other domestic and global brands. The business of selling branded apparels is driven by fashion trends, particularly in the urban regions and among consumers in the age group of 18-40 years. Thus, players such as ITFL need to constantly innovate and adapt to the changing preferences of the target segment. Currently, more than 95% of revenues of ITFL comes from the men’s category with major contribution from Shirts, Trousers, T-Shirts and Denimwear which is partially mitigated by the long-standing presence in the industry. Liquidity: Adequate Bank limit utilisation is high at around 96 percent for the past seven months ended July 2024. Cash accruals in the current fiscal will not be suffice for repayment obligation. However, the same will be met through existing liquidity and expected improvement in working capital cycle. The company maintains liquid assets in the form of mutual funds to the tune of Rs. 5.72 crore as on 31st July 2024 to support exigencies. Company is in the process of infusing equity investment of Rs.10 crore which will support the liquidity of the company. Outlook: Stable CRISIL Ratings believe ITFL will continue to benefit from its strong market position supported by the extensive experience of its promoter, and established relationships with clients. Rating Sensitivity factors Upward factors Sustained growth in revenues and sustenance of operating margin at over 9-10% leading to higher cash accruals. Improvement in interest coverage and sustenance of capital structure. Downward factors Substantial decline in revenue or profitability margin below 4-5% leading to lower net cash accrual on sustained basis Stretch in working capital adversely impacting liquidity. About the Company Incorporated in September 2009, ITFL retails ready-made garments for men, such as shirts, trousers, T-shirts, jackets, and sweaters under the Indian Terrain brand. The domestic retail division of Celebrity Fashions Ltd (CFL, rated at CRISIL BB-/Stable/CRISIL A4+) was demerged into ITFL with effect from April 1, 2010. The company has more than 200 exclusive brand outlets with a mix of company operated and franchise operated outlets along with 1000+ multi brand outlets, 400+ doors of large format stores and 5+ E-commerce partners. ITFL is listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE). The company is promoted by Mr. Venkatesh Rajagopal (Chairman & Whole Time Director) along with family. Managing director, Mr. Charath Narsimhan, manages the day-to-day operations.

Rationale
While assigning the ratings, ICRA has taken a consolidated view of Greenlam Industries Limited (GRLM) and its wholly-owned
subsidiary Greenlam Limited (GL), given the strong business, managerial and financial linkages, and they are collectively
referred as GRLM.
The rating reaffirmation reflects GRLM’s established position in the laminates industry, aided by a strong brand and wide
distribution network. The ratings favourably factor in the healthy capacity utilisation in the laminate division, backed by healthy
demand from both domestic and export markets. Its credit profile is supported by the promoter’s extensive experience and
GRLM’s established presence in the domestic and export markets. GRLM forayed into West India by acquiring a laminates unit
and then executing greenfield projects in two states, thereby extending its geographical presence into five states from two in
FY2021. With a total installed laminates capacity of 24.5 million sheets per annum, GRLM is one of the largest laminates
manufacturing companies in the country and India’s largest exporter of laminates for the past 14 years. The operating income
(OI) is likely to rise by 11-13% in FY2025, primarily led by volumetric growth, supported by improved product and geographical
diversification. The OI is expected to increase by 18-20% in FY2026, backed by the revenue contribution from the expanded
facilities in laminates, plywood and recent commencement of chipboard plant, while the operating margins are projected to
be in the range of 11.0-11.5%.
The ratings, however, are constrained by GRLM’s exposure to the inherent project implementation risks related to ramp-up
and stabilisation of the new plants. GRLM is also exposed to intense competition from large organised and numerous small
unorganised players in the decorative laminates market, which restricts pricing flexibility. With high proportion of imports and
irregular capacity addition by other leading wood panel players in India, GRLM faces offtake risks for its chipboard plant.
Nonetheless, growing penetration of merchandised furniture industry (modular kitchen units, wardrobes, etc), rising demand
for chipboard being a cheaper alternative and the strong distribution network, brand reputation could mitigate the risk to an
extent. GRLM’s operations are working capital intensive, with sizeable funds blocked in inventory due to elongated lead time,
which is partially funded by extended credit period from suppliers, thereby supporting its cash conversion cycle. While the
company has prudent hedging policy for its imported raw material to mitigate the impact of forex volatility in its core
operations, its forex exposure towards borrowings for the recently concluded capex remains unhedged and could have a
bearing on its overall profitability. The company has taken various measures to turnaround its engineering door and flooring
segments, which has been incurring losses in the past and affected the overall return metrics. ICRA takes note of the

management guidance to achieve breakeven in these divisions in FY2026, which if materialises, should positively aid return
metrics.
The continuation of Negative outlook reflects ICRA’s expectation that the credit metrics are expected to remain under pressure
in the near term, owing to the higher-than-expected debt-funded capex to fund the cost overrun, along with delay in ramp-up
of new capacities. The cost overruns were due to an increase in equipment cost, setting up basic infrastructure with a provision
for future expansion and partly towards installation of enhanced capacity. The leverage as reflected by total debt to OBIDTA is
estimated to peak at 4.2 times by March 2025 (from 3.7 times as on March 31, 2024, and 2.7 times as on March 31, 2023).
ICRA notes the commencement of production of the chipboard plant from January 23, 2025. Timely ramp-up of the recently
commissioned facilities, would remain a key rating monitorable.
Key rating drivers and their description
Credit strengths
Established presence in domestic and export markets for laminated segment, supported by strong brand presence and
distribution network – GRLM is one of the leading manufacturers and exporters of decorative laminates. It has an established
position in the laminates industry, supported by a strong brand and a wide distribution network with 5 manufacturing facilities,
17 company-owned regional distribution centres and warehouses, 21 branch offices, and over 30,000 distributors, dealers,
sub-dealers, and retailers across the country. This apart, it has 16 subsidiary companies involved in exploring market
opportunities for laminates in South-east Asia, USA, Europe, UK and other parts of the world. Globally, GRLM has presence in
over 120 countries through 4 company-operated international distribution centres, 21 international offices. With total installed
laminates capacity of 24.5 million sheets per annum, GRLM is one of the largest laminate manufacturing companies in the
country and India’s largest exporter of laminates for the past 14 years.
Healthy growth in scale of operations expected to continue in medium term – GRLM has increased its laminates capacity by
around 28% to 24.5 million sheets per annum as of date, from 19.1 million sheet per annum as on September 30, 2022. Further,
a new plywood plant with an installed capacity of 18.9 million sqm was commissioned at Tamil Nadu (in June 2023), and the
chipboard facility of 2,92,380 CBM capacity commenced production from January 23, 2025, improving GRLM’s product
diversification. On a consolidated basis, it reported 14% year-on-year (YoY) growth in operating revenue to Rs. 2,306 crore in
FY2024 from Rs. 2,026 crore in FY2023. Further, it reported an OI of Rs. 1,888 crore in 9M FY2025, supported by healthy
demand and increased realisation across product segments. GRLM’s operating margins improved to 12.9% in FY2024, against
11.5% in FY2023 and 11.0% in FY2022. Going forward, its OI is likely to rise by 11-13% in FY2025, primarily led by volumetric
growth, driven by improved product and geographical diversification. However, its margins are expected to slightly moderate
in FY2025 due to the ramp-up phase of the recently commissioned capacities (OPM of 11.1% in 9M FY2025). The OI is expected
to increase by 18-20% in FY2026, backed by the revenue contribution from the expanded facilities in laminates, plywood and
recent commencement of chipboard plant, while the operating margins are projected to be in the range of 11.0-11.5%.
Healthy demand prospects likely to support medium-term growth – The capacity utilisation of the laminate division which
accounts for ~90% of the total revenues, has remained healthy, backed by healthy demand from both domestic and export
markets. The improved demand from the real estate industry is likely to support the demand for wood panel products in the
medium term.
Credit challenges
Ramp up of recently commissioned facilities and moderate debt protection metrics – GRLM has recently commenced
production for its chipboard facility of 2,92,380 CBM capacity from January 23, 2025. Further, the laminate projects in Prantij,
Gujarat (COD: May 2023), plywood project in Tindivanam, Tamil Nadu (COD: June 2023) and the laminate project in Andhra
Pradesh (COD: September 2023) have started over the last two years. With high proportion of imports and irregular capacity
addition by other leading wood panel players in India, GRLM faces offtake risks for its recently completed chipboard plant.

Nonetheless, growing penetration of merchandised furniture industry (modular kitchen units, wardrobes, etc), rising demand
for chipboard being a cheaper alternative and the strong distribution network, brand reputation could mitigate the risk to an
extent. Timely ramp-up of the recently commissioned facilities would remain a key rating monitorable.
The company’s credit metrics are expected to remain under pressure in the near term, owing to higher-than-expected debt-
funded capex to fund cost overrun, along with delay in ramp-up of new capacities. The cost overruns were due to an increase
in equipment cost, setting up basic infrastructure with a provision for future expansion and partly towards installation of
enhanced capacity. The leverage as reflected by total debt to OBIDTA is estimated to peak at 4.2 times by March 2025 (from
3.7 times as on March 31, 2024, and 2.7 times as on March 31, 2023). Consequently, the debt coverage metrics are expected
to remain moderate. However, ICRA expects improvement in the projected debt protection metrics in the medium term,
supported by ramp of the recently commissioned facilities.
Vulnerability of earnings to fluctuations in raw material prices and exchange rates; intense competition in decorative
laminates business – GRLM’s operating margins are exposed to volatility in prices of key raw materials such as paper and
chemicals viz., melamine, methanol and phenol, which are crude oil/gas derivatives and fluctuations in exchange rates, given
a sizeable import of raw materials and export of its products. Nonetheless, the raw material prices have largely stabilised
during the recent quarters. GRLM’s operations are working capital intensive, with sizeable funds blocked in inventory due to
an elongated lead time, which is partially funded by an extended credit period from suppliers, thereby supporting the cash
conversion cycle. While the company has prudent hedging policy for its imported raw material to mitigate the impact of forex
volatility in its core operations, its forex exposure towards borrowings for the recently concluded capex remains unhedged
and could have a bearing on the overall profitability. GRLM is also exposed to intense competition from large organised and
numerous small unorganised players in the decorative laminates market, which restricts its pricing flexibility.
Environmental and social risks
Manufacturing of laminates requires a substantial use of paper and chemicals such as melamine and phenolic resins. The
process involves toxic emissions from phenolic resins during the laminating process. GRLM is already complying with the
relevant pollution control norms. However, further increasing regulatory requirements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
and stricter air pollution standards may lead to higher costs for GRLM. The profitability and cash flows could be under pressure
if it is not able to fully pass on the higher compliance costs to the customers. The social risks relate to the safety of employees
involved in the manufacturing and transportation of laminates and wood panel products. GRLM has made investments in
mechanisation to enhance physical safety.
Liquidity position: Adequate
GRLM’s liquidity is adequate with cash and liquid investments of Rs. 90.7 crore as of December 2024. The company had a
balance cost (including capex creditors and retention money) of around Rs. 140 crore as on January 23, 2025 which will be
funded through undrawn limits of ~Rs. 40 crore, and the remaining through internal accruals. There are no other major capex
plans in the medium term. It has debt repayment obligation (excluding lease liabilities) of Rs. 110 crore in FY2026, which can
be adequately met through its estimated cash flow from operations.
Rating sensitivities
Positive factors – The outlook could be revised to Stable upon demonstration of a material improvement in earnings leading
to healthy improvement in debt protection metrics with ramp-up of the recently commissioned facilities.
Negative factors – Pressure on GRLM’s ratings could arise in case of a material decline in revenues and earnings or if there is
a deterioration in the working capital cycle on a sustained basis. Any significant delay in ramp up of the recently completed
capex or inability to improve the debt protection metrics could also impact the ratings.

Rationale
The rating continues to factor in the extensive experience of Shalby Limited’s (Shalby) Founder-Promoter, Dr. Vikram Shah,
who along with the management team, has a demonstrated track record of more than two decades in the healthcare industry.
The rating also derives comfort from the strong brand equity of Shalby in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra, and Madhya
Pradesh, with a growing presence in Central, North and West India. The company has also leveraged its strong brand equity
by expanding its footprint in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and new territories such as Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh,
among others, by using the asset-light franchisee approach of establishing Shalby Orthopaedic Centre of Excellence (SOCE).
Further, the rating considers Shalby’s leadership position in the arthroplasty speciality segment as well as its diversification in
nephrology, urology, cardiology, oncology, and other non-arthroplasty segments. ICRA also positively factors in the increase
in the footfall of international patients with the acquisition of Sanar Hospital and expects the same to start contributing to the
company’s profits from FY2026. ICRA also continues to derive comfort from the operational metrics of Shalby’s existing
hospital, aided by positive long-term demand outlook for healthcare services in India amid increasing affordability (by virtue
of increasing per capita income), widening medical insurance coverage and under-penetration of healthcare services. ICRA
also notes Shalby’s endeavour to diversify its consolidated operations by scaling up its implant division, which is expected to
witness a 50% YoY growth in its top line in FY2025. However, continued losses and high debt-backed inventory levels remain
a concern.
Shalby witnessed a healthy YoY revenue (consolidated) growth of ~20% in 9M FY2025 and ~16% in FY2024. During the same
period, Shalby’s standalone existing hospital revenues (excluding Sanar Hospital) improved by ~7% on a YoY basis to Rs. 665.5
crore from Rs. 623.4 crore in 9M FY2024. While revenues grew, the consolidated Operating Profit Margin (OPM) declined to
13.6% in 9M FY2025 from 20% in 9M FY2024. The pressure on profitability is largely on the back of lower occupancy levels,
particularly in Sanar, deferment of surgeries in Q2 FY2025 due to floods in Rajasthan and Gujarat, low returns from the implant
business and certain one-off expenses in Q3 FY2025. Provisioning for slow moving inventory for the implant business also
resulted in margin contraction to a certain extent.
The rating, however, remains constrained by the growing, though moderate, occupancy level of the company (~47.5% in 9M
FY2025), which has been further exacerbated by the low occupancy level at the Sanar Hospital, which is currently operating at
average occupancy rate (AOR) of ~25%. The rating is also constrained by the low return on capital employed (RoCE) of ~8.5%
in FY2024 at a consolidated level on account of expansion of hospitals as well as the impact of acquisition of Shalby Advanced

Technologies, USA (SAT), which is yet to generate meaningful profits. The risk of attrition of doctors also remains, although the
risk is partly mitigated by Shalby’s strong brand pull and long-term contracts with doctors. Moreover, the rating considers
Shalby’s reliance on its flagship hospital, SG Highway, for revenue and operating profitability. Nonetheless, the contribution of
other hospitals has been increasing gradually, supported by healthy growth of other hospitals. ICRA also notes that the
company has a new hospital under construction, where timely commencement of operations and ramp-up of the same will
continue to remain a key monitorable.
ICRA also notes that Shalby, through its step-down subsidiary, SAT, diversified into the implants and joint manufacturing
business by acquiring the assets of Consensus Orthopedics, USA, in Q1 FY2022. While the same is expected to provide
diversification to revenues and supplement its in-house sourcing of implants in the long run, the acquisition was largely debt
funded. Besides, its inventories continue to be funded by working capital borrowings, which resulted in increased consolidated
debt levels. In FY2024, SAT witnessed significant revenue decline and profit contraction at the operating level. In the current
fiscal, while revenue has grown, the company is yet to generate meaningful returns. Further, the inventory levels which are
entirely funded through working capital debt, continue to remain elevated. ICRA notes the current high inventory holding (~Rs.
214 crore, as on December 31, 2024) as SAT is planning to launch new products in Q4 FY2025 and FY2026, in addition to the
inventory pile-up in the growth phase of its operations. Going forward, timely liquidation of inventory along with remediation
of supply chain issues in addition to the ramp-up and profitability of the implants business will be monitored.
The debt levels increased significantly in FY2024 to fund the acquisition of the Sanar Hospital and its asset holding entity,
Healers Hospital Private Limited (HHPL). This coupled with the increasing working capital requirement to fund the inventory
requirements in the implant business has resulted in moderation in debt metrics, as characterised by Total Debt/OPBDITA of
3 times as on September 30, 2024 against 2.1 times as on March 31, 2024. The interest coverage and Debt Service Coverage
Ratio (DSCR) have also been adversely impacted during the period. Going forward, the company has capex plans in terms of
investment in radiation equipment, towards a greenfield project in Mumbai and planned bed expansion in Sanar. While the
term debt for radiation equipment has already been tied up, rest of the investments are expected to be funded through
internal accruals and available liquidity. With the expected improvement in profitability of the hospital business in FY2026 and
reduction in losses/turnaround of the implants business over the near-to-medium term, ICRA expects the company's debt
metrics to improve.
Key rating drivers and their description
Credit strengths
Experienced management team with strong execution track record – Shalby is a publicly listed entity, promoted by renowned
joint replacement specialist, Dr. Vikram Shah, who has over 28 years of medical experience in the UK, the US and India. Its
overall operations are also supported by its senior management, with an average experience of more than 12 years in
healthcare services in India and abroad. Shalby enjoys strong goodwill among patients and healthcare professionals, which has
helped it grow over the years. The company’s brand equity is also boosted by numerous doctors, who are trained at Shalby on
a regular basis.
Strong market position in the Indian arthroplasty hospital segment – Shalby remains the largest specialist joint replacement
provider in the world, with an average of 16,000-18,000 surgeries per year. The company enjoys a strong market position in
the healthcare services industry in northern, western and central India, especially underpinned by its established position in
the arthroplasty segment. Arthroplasty has remained the key revenue and profit generator for Shalby over the years. The
company has a healthy market share in the segment in India.
Rising diversification towards non-arthroplasty segments; increased international exposure with acquisition of Sanar
Hospital – Over the past few years, the share of non-arthroplasty segments in Shalby’s total revenue has been increasing
steadily, contributing ~65% to the total revenue in Q3 FY2025. Among the non-arthroplasty segments, nephrology, urology,
oncology and cardiac procedures have been the largest revenue contributors, followed by critical care and general medicine.

Further, with the acquisition of Sanar, the company’s international exposure is expected to improve as there is a high influx of
international patients in Sanar.
Credit challenges
Overall moderate occupancy levels – The overall occupancy levels for Shalby remained moderate at ~47.5% in 9M FY2025, in
line with the historic trends. While the occupancy levels have fluctuated in the range of 45-50%, the number of beds occupied
has increased in the current fiscal. The number of occupied beds has gradually picked up in the current fiscal due to continued
demand for elective surgeries. Despite the low overall occupancy levels, the company’s operating income is supported by
healthy ARPOB levels, which improved to Rs. 42,704 in Q3 FY2025 from Rs. 37,517 in FY2024. The ARPOB growth has been
consistent every quarter owing to better case and specialty mix and improving payor mix (with improvement in revenues from
cash and insurance patients). While healthy demand for elective surgeries is expected to support the overall business prospects
of the company, the average occupancy levels amid the ongoing capacity expansion and addition of SOCEs will remain a key
credit monitorable.
High dependence on flagship hospital, SG Highway, for revenue and profitability; although contribution from other hospitals
has been increasing gradually – Historically, Shalby has derived a significant percentage of its total revenue from its flagship
hospital, SG Highway. That said, the contribution of other hospitals to revenues and operating profit is improving with a healthy
ramp up in revenues at some of the other units.
High working capital intensity of implants business – The working capital intensity of the implants business housed under SAT
remains high owing to the high inventory holding nature of the business, in addition to the current, growth stage of operations
when the company is also launching several new products and therefore stocking its inventory. The requirement and support
of instruments required to perform a surgery further contributes to the elevated inventory levels. ICRA notes the current high
inventory holding (~Rs. 214 crore, as on December 31, 2024) at SAT, following the company’s plans to launch new products in
Q4 FY2025 and FY2026, in addition to the high inventory levels owing to consistent fresh launches as the company continues
to be in a growing phase. While part of the funding requirements of SAT has been met by its ultimate parent company, it has
also availed significant working capital debt to fund its inventory requirements. Going forward, timely liquidation of inventory
along with remediation of supply chain issues, in addition to ramp-up and profitability of the implants business, will remain
key monitorables.
Also, with the increasing debt levels, the debt metrics have deteriorated as characterized by the ratio of Total debt/Operating
profit of 3 times as on September 30th 2024 from 2.1 times as on March 31st 2024. The interest coverage and Debt Service
Coverage Ratio (DSCR) have also been adversely impacted during the period. Going forward, the company has capex plans in
terms of investment in radiation equipment, towards a greenfield project in Mumbai and planned bed expansion in Sanar.
While the term debt for radiation equipment has already been tied up, rest of the investments are expected to be funded
through internal accruals and available liquidity. With the expected improvement in profitability of the hospital business in
FY2026 and reduction in losses/turnaround of the implants business over the near-to-medium term, ICRA expects the
company's debt metrics to improve.
Ability to profitably scale up planned expansion of hospitals remains critical – Shalby has expanded its capacity significantly
by launching new hospitals at Jabalpur (Madhya Pradesh), Indore (Madhya Pradesh) and Mohali (Punjab) during FY2015-
FY2016, while new hospitals were set up in Naroda (outskirts of Ahmedabad, Gujarat), Surat (Gujarat) and Jaipur in FY2017,
which became operational in FY2018. Further, the company has employed an asset-light franchisee model of growth where it
sets up smaller, super speciality hospitals focused on orthopaedic services called SOCEs. The company currently operates four
SOCEs in Ahmedabad (Gujarat), Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh), Gwalior (Madhya Pradesh) and Ranchi (Jharkhand). Currently, Shalby
is in the process of setting up a greenfield hospital in Mumbai, which is expected to commence operations from FY2028. While
ICRA expects the company’s profitability and debt metrics to remain healthy, going forward, timely commencement of these
hospitals within the budgeted cost and its ability to scale up the same will remain critical.

Besides, in the current fiscal, Sanar Hospital is generating losses at the operating level because of low occupancy rate of 25%
and dent in the surgery volumes owing to churn in doctors. Once the occupancy improves and onboarding of new doctors
stabilises, Sanar is expected to generate sequentially better margins owing to higher footfalls from international patients. That
said, ability to scale up Sanar’s occupancy and generate profitability remains critical for Shalby’s hospital operations.
Environment and Social Risks
Environmental considerations – The hospital sector does not face any major physical climate risk. However, hospitals need to
comply with environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the handling and disposal of bio-medical specimens,
wastewater, infectious and hazardous waste. The company ensures that waste disposal for its hospitals is in accordance with
the Government guidelines, ensuring minimum generation of radiation or infection. E-waste disposal is conducted through an
authorised agent. With respect to sanitation and water conservation, the company has undertaken various measures to recycle
the same and make efficient use of water. The company has also taken adequate measures to meet all Government regulations
with respect to solid waste, medical waste, and water conservation to minimise any business disruption.
Social considerations – Exposure to social risks is moderate for the hospital sector. Social risks for industry players include
litigation exposure and compliance with standard requirements, given the importance of the services being provided. Further,
regulatory interventions such as price control measures, imposition of restrictions, if any, specifically levied could impact the
earnings of industry players. The company has had no major litigations with respect to the above.
Liquidity position: Adequate
Shalby’s liquidity position remains adequate, supported by free cash balances and liquid investment of ~Rs. 148 crore as on
December 31st, 2024. The liquidity is further supported by unutilised, fund-based working capital facilities of ~Rs. 78 crore, at
a standalone hospital level, the average utilisation of which has remained almost nil in the past 12 months. Going forward, the
company is expected to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its scheduled repayments, which stood at ~Rs.
39 crore and Rs. 46 crore in FY2025 and FY2026, respectively. That said, the working capital requirements for its implants
business (as the revenue continues to increase) will remain one of the key monitorables, going forward. Further, the capex is
expected to be funded through internal accruals, going forward, with the exception of planned investment in radiation
equipment, for which the funding has already been tied up.
Rating sensitivities
Positive factors – ICRA could upgrade the rating if a sustained increase in occupancy increases revenue and profitability, which
in turn improves debt coverage indicators and strengthens the overall liquidity profile. A sustained revenue growth and
operating margin in the implants business will also be a key factor for a rating upgrade.
Negative factors – Pressure on the company’s ratings could arise if total debt/ OPBDITA metrics is over 2.3 times on a sustained
basis or if there is any significant time or cost overrun in the under-construction hospitals, or delay in turnaround of new
ventures, impacting the overall financial profile. Further, any higher-than-expected debt-funded capex or that which materially
weakens the coverage indicators, will also be a negative rating trigger. Any adverse outcome of litigations/lawsuits would
remain an event risk. The impact of such events on the company’s business and credit profiles and liquidity position would be
monitored on a case-to-case basis.

For arriving at the ratings, ICRA has considered the consolidated financials of Shalby Limited.
Consolidation/Standalone As on March 31, 2024, the company had eight direct subsidiaries, and two step-down
subsidiaries, details of which are enlisted in Annexure-II.
About the company
Shalby is promoted by the arthroplasty specialist, Dr. Vikram Shah, who commenced hospital operations under the company
with a six-bed facility in Ahmedabad in 1994. Shalby currently operates a chain of multi-specialty healthcare facilities with over
2,350 bed capacity. Shalby has a strong presence in western and central India with 11 operational multi-speciality hospitals in
Ahmedabad, Vapi (Gujarat), Surat (Gujarat), Jaipur, Indore (Madhya Pradesh), Jabalpur (Madhya Pradesh), Mohali (Punjab),
Gurgaon and Mumbai; and 5 super speciality hospitals in Udaipur (Rajasthan), Ahmedabad, Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh), Gwalior
(Madhya Pradesh) and Ranchi (Jharkhand). Shalby also operates 60+ OPD centres across India. It operates 23 clinics in East
African countries, Iraq, Dubai, Oman, Bangladesh, and Nepal. Its operations initially focused on arthroplasty procedures (knee
and hip replacements), following which the company expanded to include other specialities such as oncology, bariatrics,
cardiology, neurosurgery, etc., over the last few years. The company acquired a hospital named ‘Sanar International’ in Q4
FY2024 where the majority of the footfall is derived from international patients and is currently operational as ‘Shalby Sanar
Hospital’.
Further, in FY2021, Shalby acquired a company in the US to manufacture high quality USFDA approved implants. This was an
attempt towards backward integration in orthopaedics with in-house capacity and to become a vertically integrated in-house
manufacturing facility. As of now, SAT has presence across the US, Japan, India and Indonesia.

Facilities/Instruments Rating1 Rating Action
(₹ crore)
Long Term / Short Term Bank CARE A; Stable / CARE Reaffirmed; Outlook revised from
91.00
Facilities A1 Negative
Details of instruments/facilities in Annexure-1.
Rationale and key rating drivers
The rating reaffirmation and revision in outlook on long-term rating to stable from negative factors in improvement in profitability
of Bhageria Industries Limited’s (BIL) chemicals segment following relative stability in prices of key chemicals in recent quarters
and improving demand for dyes and dye intermediates from end-user industries including textiles. In Q1FY25, revenue from BIL’s
chemicals segment grew by ~6% y-o-y to ₹94.09 crore with profit before interest, lease rentals, depreciation, and taxation
(PBILDT) margins recovering to 3.15% against -3.18% in Q1FY24 and 2.87% in FY24. Its solar power and other business
segments continue to record stable performance. CARE Ratings Limited (CARE Ratings) expects BIL’s profitability to improve in
FY25, as compared to FY24, driven by improvement in chemicals business, translating into healthy cash generation from
operations which, in the absence of sizeable organic/inorganic expansion plans, are likely to support BIL’s credit profile over the
near-to-medium term. While reaffirming the rating, CARE Ratings notes the company’s plans to expand in pharmaceutical API
segment with production of B-12 APIs, where it has spent ~₹17 crore through internal accruals and no additional capex planned
in near term. Further, it has achieved WHO-GMP certification, while it waits for other necessary approvals.
The rating continues to factor in the company’s long track record and extensive experience of its promoters. BIL’s capital structure
remains comfortable marked by overall gearing at 0.10x and total outside liability to total net worth (TOL/TNW) at 0.26x with
tangible net worth of ₹518.56 crore as on March 31, 2024, and coverage indicators marked by interest coverage at 24.33x in
FY24 and expectations of stable demand for dyes and dye intermediates in the near-to-medium term. The rating also considers
healthy diversification in BIL’s revenue and profits from its solar power segment. Additionally, the rating also factors in the strong
liquidity with healthy cash accruals against moderate repayment obligation in medium term and sizeable free cash and bank
balances of ₹45.15 crore as on March 31, 2024.
However, the rating remains constrained by subdued operational performance in FY24, where BIL’s total operating income (TOI)
marginally declined on y-o-y basis to ₹495.78 crore as compared to ₹501.49 crore and PBILDT margin of 9.10% as compared to
10.88% considering decline in realisation per kilogram. Additionally, dyes and dye intermediate segment witnessed headwinds in
FY24 owing to weak demand from key consuming sectors, mainly the textile industry. Further, the rating is constrained by the
vulnerability of the company’s profitability to adverse fluctuation in raw material costs, forex fluctuations and intense competition
in the industry. The company’s performance, also, remains susceptible to the risk associated with adaptation of stringent
environmental control norms of government.
Rating sensitivities: Factors likely to lead to rating actions
Positive Factors
▪ Significantly increasing scale of operation and improving PBILDT margin from chemical segment on a sustained basis.
▪ Improving return on capital employed (ROCE) above 20% on a sustained basis.
Negative Factors
▪ Significantly declining scale of operation and PBILDT margin below 10% leading to declining cash accruals.
▪ Larger than anticipated debt-funded capex or leveraged acquisition, leading to sustained and major deteriorating
leverage to above 0.75x or debt coverage indicators or significantly stretching working capital cycle.
Analytical approach: Consolidated
Consolidated financials have been considered due to presence of common management, brand name, and operational linkages
with subsidiary. List of entities considered for consolidation mentioned in Annexure- 6.
Outlook: Stable
Stable outlook reflects that the rated entity will continue to benefit from its established track record and expected improvement
in contribution levels of chemical business translating into healthy cash generation supporting the credit profile.

Press Release
Detailed description of key rating drivers:
Key strengths
Favorable capital structure and comfortable debt coverage indicators
BIL’s financial risk profile stood comfortable marked by healthy net worth, low gearing and strong debt protection metrics. Its net
worth stood at ₹518.56 crore as on March 31, 2024 (PY: 504.59 crore). Capital structure stood favourable marked by overall gearing
at 0.10x (PY: 0.12x) and TOL/TNW at 0.26x (PY: 0.20x) as on March 31, 2024 with improvement on a y-o-y basis considering
decline in total debt to ₹50.75 crore as on March 31, 2024, from ₹52.20 crore as on March 31, 2023, and improvement in net worth
owing to accretion of profits. In FY24, debt coverage indicators stood comfortable marked by total debt to gross cash accruals
(TD/GCA) at 1.03x (PY: 1.25x) and interest coverage ratio improving y-o-y to 24.33x (PY: 15.46x) considering lower interest cost
due to lower working capital utilisation. CARE Ratings expects BIL to maintain a comfortable credit profile in the near-to-medium
term in absence of sizeable organic/inorganic expansion plans.
Extensive experience of promoters and established relations with reputed clientele
BIL, incorporated in 1989, is promoted by Suresh Bhageria and Vinod Bhageria, who have over three decades of experience in
dyes and dyes intermediates industry. Clientele includes some of the reputed domestic and global companies, Everlight Chemical
Industrial Corporation, Huntsman International (India) Private Limited among others. As a result of long-standing experience and
consistency in supply, BIL has been able to garner repeat orders from its existing clientele and has also added some large export
customers in the past. BIL has moderate customer concentration, where its top ten customer contribute ~55-60% of its total
revenue from chemical division. The company will benefit from the extensive experience of promoters and its long-standing
relationship with clientele in future.
Consistent revenue and profit contribution from its solar plant
BIL entered in solar power generation in 2015 by commissioning ~3.78 MW solar power capacity, most of which is at Chennai
and has power purchase agreement (PPA) for 25 years at ₹6.61 per MW. BIL also commissioned 30MW(AC) solar power plant in
July 2017 at Ahmednagar, Maharashtra having entered in 25-year PPA with Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI; a company
under Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Government of India) at a fixed tariff of ₹4.41/unit. Consequent to stabilisation of
its solar power plants, there has been healthy revenue (~₹27-30 crore) and profit contribution from solar division.
Well-established backward integrated manufacturing operations
BIL’s operations are backward integrated with in-house manufacturing of its key dye intermediates. In the dye intermediates
segment, manufacturing capacity mainly comprises Vinyl Sulphone (VS) of 3,600 MTPA, H-acid of 4,800 MTPA and as a backward
integration measure, BIL has setup a capacity to manufacture Sulphuric Acid (300 Tonnes Per Day). Furthermore, the company
expanded in dye intermediates with capacity of 4,500 MTPA for manufacturing of J-Acid and Tobias Acid for which commercial
operations commenced from May 27, 2021. Thus, with introduction of new product to portfolio, product mix or revenue diversity
of the company has improved.
Key weaknesses
Moderate revenues and profitability
BIL’s TOI registered a marginal decline of 1.13% on y-o-y basis to ₹495.78 crore as compared to ₹501.49 crore in FY23 marked
by ~15% y-o-y decline in revenue from chemicals segment while revenue from solar power segment remained stable in the range
of ₹28-29 crore and the other business segment contributed ~₹68 crores. Decline in revenue from chemicals segment was
primarily due to lower off-take from customers and lower realisation due to industry-wide headwinds. BIL’s PBILDT margin also
marginally declined on y-o-y basis to 9.10% in FY24 as compared to 10.88% in FY23. This decline was primarily due to lower
sales realisation and an increase in the cost of production owing to fluctuation in prices of raw materials. However, profit after
taxation (PAT) margin has marginally improved on y-o-y to 3.74% in FY24 as compared to 2.93% in FY23 considering lower interest
cost owing to lower working capital utilisation and depreciation expense. In Q1FY25, TOI stood at ₹112.52 crore with PBILDT
margin of 10.29% against Q1FY24, TOI stood at ₹97.49 crore with PBILDT margin of 6.34%. Furthermore, achieving the envisaged
operating margins remains a key rating monitorable for the company.
Operations of the company remain susceptible to changes in environmental regulations
Since companies manufacturing dyes and dye intermediates generate a lot of hazardous substances and waste materials, they
are subject to central, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to pollution control, protection of environment,
greenhouse gas emissions and generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of these
hazardous substances and waste materials. Costs and capital expenditures relating to environmental, health or safety matters are
subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend on the timing of promulgation and enforcement of specific standards
which impose requirements. Changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt operations of these companies or
may require modifications to their facilities. Accordingly, environmental, health or safety regulatory matters could result in
significant unanticipated costs or liabilities. BIL is a member of Central Effluent treatment Plant, Taloja (CETP), Tarapur
Environmental Protection Society (TEPS) and Mumbai Waste Management Limited, Taloja (MWML), and follows best in class
process controls and systems.

Press Release
Exposure of profitability to raw material price volatility and foreign exchange rates
Principle raw materials required are sulphur, tobias acid (derivative of naphthalene), beta naphthol, caustic soda flakes,
naphthalene (crude derivative), and aniline which form ~70% of raw material cost. Most raw materials are derivatives of crude
oil, and their prices vary in accordance with variation in international market price of crude oil. Hence, BIL’s profitability is susceptible
to volatility in prices of raw materials. The company derives ~16% from exports which exposes its profitability to fluctuations in
foreign exchange rate. The company is net exporter; hence it mitigates risk to some extent through natural hedge and for the
balance part it further hedges based on market situation.
Working capital intensive operations
BIL’s operations are working capital intensive due to sizeable receivables and inventory holding requirements. Working capital
cycle stood at moderate levels of 99 days as on March 31, 2024 (PY: 97 days). In FY24, collection days stood at 104 days (PY:
89 days) and inventory days stood at 36 days (PY: 45 days), while creditor days stood at 40 days (PY: 37 days).
The company has adequate cushion in its working capital borrowings to support elongation in the working capital cycle.
Liquidity: Strong
BIL has strong liquidity marked by healthy cash accruals generation in the range of ₹52-54 crore in projected years against
moderate long-term repayment obligations of ₹9crore, low average working capital utilisation and no plans to raise additional
external debt in the near-to-medium term horizon. In addition, as on March 31, 2024, unencumbered cash/bank balance including
fixed deposits (excluding FD marked as lien) stood at ₹45.15 crore while average working capital utilisation stood at ~9.45% for
the twelve months ended June 24. With a gearing of 0.10x as on March 31, 2024, BIL has sufficient gearing headroom, to raise
additional debt for its capex, if needed. In FY24, net cash flow from operations stood at ₹21.69 crore (net CFO remained positive
in last five years). As on March 31, 2024, current ratio stood at 2.49x and quick ratio stood at 2.12x.

The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities Detailed Rationale Crisil Ratings has revised its outlook on the corporate credit rating of Ideaforge Technology Limited (IFTL; part of Ideaforge Group) to ‘Negative’ from ‘Stable’ while reaffirming the rating at ‘Crisil BBB+’. The revision in outlook reflects the moderation in the business risk profile over the last 9 months and an expectation that it will weaken over the medium term. During 9M FY 25, operating performance of the company has been impacted due to delay in conversion of L1 orders resulting in lower execution. Lower than expected and delayed spending by end users on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles has impacted L1 conversion. Currently, the group significantly relies on defense orders from the government. While group is diversifying into the export market with opportunities in sight, the conversion of the same into revenue remains to be seen. The group continues to incur operating expenses and investment in product development (research and development) to support its growing product portfolio and increasing patents. The group has reported an operating loss of 21.9% in 9M FY 25 against operating profit of 19% during 9 M FY 24. Though the group is expected to get long-term benefits from spend on R&D, operating profitability will remain key monitorable over medium term. However, the group’s financial risk profile continues to remain healthy supporting the credit profile. The group has healthy cash and cash equivalents including current investments  of Rs.285.38 Crores and nil debt as on 30th Sept 2024. The ratings continue to reflect robust financial risk profile and  an established market position of the group in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) industry. These strengths are partially offset by higher dependence on government orders, working capital intensive nature of operations and partial susceptibility of revenue and operating profitability to tender based business. Analytical Approach Crisil Ratings has consolidated the business and financial risk profiles of IFTL with its subsidiary Ideaforge Technology INC together referred to as Ideaforge Group. This is because Ideaforge Technology INC is a 100% subsidiary of the company and is expected to be in the same line of business. Please refer Annexure - List of Entities Consolidated, which captures the list of entities considered and their analytical treatment of consolidation. Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description Strengths: Robust financial risk profile: Limited reliance on debt has led to a robust financial risk profile of the group. The financial risk profile of the group is marked by healthy networth of Rs 576.92 Cr and low gearing at nil times as on March 31, 2024. Despite moderation in operating margin, debt protection metrics of the group continue to remain comfortable with interest coverage ratio over 15 times and net cash accruals to adjusted debt at nil times for fiscal 2024. As on September 30, 2024, networth of the company was at Rs.564.36 Crores with ‘Nil’ gearing. Established market position: Group benefits from the promoters’ experience of more than a decade and their strong understanding of market dynamics, which should continue to support the business risk profile. Over the decades, the group has developed strong engineering and design capabilities which have helped it in meeting the changing demands from its customers. Further, the group has maintained a strong focus on R&D, which has helped them develop a wide range of products and solutions in the drone industry resulting in established market position and healthy market share. Weaknesses: Higher dependence on government orders: As on 9MFY25 the group has generated 65% of revenue from defense segment. Defense procurement cycles are long and unpredictable, which can lead to revenue volatility. Any changes in government policies or sluggish tender flow can lead to loss of revenue over the medium term. While the group is diversifying into the export market, its benefits remain to be seen. Working capital intensive operations:Operations continue to remain working capital intensive as reflected by gross current assets of 236 days as on March 31, 2024, which is majorly driven by inventory of 139 to 280 days and debtors of 57 to 125 days. Since the group’s customers include government bodies and longer schedules for deliveries, debtors and inventory levels are expected to remain high. Susceptibility of scale of operations and operating profitability to tender based business: Despite a group having well-diversified products providing different profitability, its business performance is majorly dependent on the nature of the tender received from its customers, owing to which both scale and profitability are expected to remain volatile. Liquidity: Adequate Bank limit utilization is Nil for the past twelve months ended Dec 2024. The current ratio is healthy at 8.76 times on March 31, 2024. High cash and cash equivalents including current investments  of Rs.285.38 Crores, will support the liquidity . Outlook: Negative Scale of operations and profitability may remain constrained in case on non-conversion of existing pipeline to the revenue which may impact business risk profile over the medium term. Rating sensitivity factors Upward factors: Sustained scale of operations with operating margin remaining above 20% resulting in higher-than-expected net cash accruals Sustenance of healthy financial risk profile with comfortable capital structure Downward factors: Higher than expected decline in scale of operations and continued operating losses leading to net cash accruals below Rs 25 crores Stretch in working capital cycle weakening liquidity prospects About the Group IFTL was incorporated in 2007. The company is engaged in the business of manufacture and marketing of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems such as wide range of megaphone drone, Q series drone, switch UAV drone which are used for mapping, surveillance & security, survey and inspection purposes. IFTL has incorporated a subsidiary in USA in Sept 2022 to expand into US market and other newer geographies.

Rating Rationale Rating Rationale September 28, 2023 | Mumbai Sarthak Metals LimitedIssuer not cooperating, based on best-available information; Rating Revised to be ‘CRISIL BB+/Stable Issuer not cooperating'; Rating Withdrawn Rating ActionTotal Bank Loan Facilities RatedRs.27.25 CroreLong Term RatingCRISIL BB+/Stable (ISSUER NOT COOPERATING*; Revised from ‘CRISIL BBB/Positive ISSUER NOT COOPERATING*’)Note: None of the Directors on CRISIL Ratings Limited’s Board are members of rating committee and thus do not participate in discussion or assignment of any ratings. The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities*Issuer did not cooperate; based on best-available information Please note that the rating(s) are based on best available information with the credit rating agency: the entity whose debt is being published via this rating rationale did not provide the requisite information needed to conduct the rating exercise or did not provide the No Default Statements (NDS) for the last three months and is therefore classified as 'non cooperative'. Non cooperation by Issuer CRISIL Ratings has been consistently following up with Sarthak Metals Limited (SML) for obtaining information through letters and emails dated August 24, 2023 among others, apart from telephonic communication. However, the issuer has remained non cooperative and the ratings on bank facilities of SML revised to  'CRISIL BB+/Stable Issuer not cooperating’ from CRISIL BBB/Positive Issuer Not Cooperating'. Earlier, the entity did not provide the No Default Statements (NDS) for the three consecutive months. Therefore, the issuer was classified as 'non cooperative' in line with Clause 11. 3 of SEBI CRA Operational Circular dated January 06, 2023. ‘The investors, lenders and all other market participants should exercise due caution with reference to the rating assigned/reviewed with the suffix 'ISSUER NOT COOPERATING' as the rating is arrived at without any management interaction and is based on best available or limited or dated information on the company. Such non co-operation by a rated entity may be a result of deterioration in its credit risk profile. These ratings with 'ISSUER NOT COOPERATING' suffix lack a forward looking component.’ Detailed Rationale Despite repeated attempts to engage with the management, CRISIL Ratings failed to receive any information on either the financial performance or strategic intent of SML, which restricts CRISIL Ratings’ ability to take a forward looking view on the entity's credit quality. CRISIL Ratings believes that rating action on SML is consistent with ‘Assessing Information Adequacy Risk’. Based on the last available information, the ratings on bank facilities of SML revised to ‘CRISIL BB+/Stable Issuer Not Cooperting’ from ‘CRISIL BBB/Positive Issuer Not Cooperating’. CRISIL Ratings has withdrawn its rating on the bank facilities of SML on the request of the company and after receiving no objection certificate from the bank. The rating action is in-line with CRISIL Rating's policy on withdrawal of its rating on bank loan facilities. About the Company SML was set up in 1995, in Durg, Chhattisgarh and is promoted by Mr. Manoj Bansal, Mr. Anoop Bansal and Mr. Kishor Bansal. The company manufactures metallurgical cored wires and aluminum flipping coil.

Detailed Rationale of the Rating Action The affirmation reflects OBL’s comfortable credit profile in FY24 despite a decline in the profitability. Furthermore, the favourable shift in the company’s product mix towards high-margin vitrified tiles and higher demand for the same supported an improvement in OBL’s profitability in 9MFY25 and these factors are likely to continue to bolster the company’s performance in the medium term. The ratings are supported by adequate liquidity, with unutilised working capital limits and adequate unencumbered cash balance, supported by cash flows, which would cover the repayments falling due over FY26-FY27. List of Key Rating Drivers Strengths Comfortable credit metrics; likely to remain stable in FY26 Change in product mix; performance likely to improve in FY26 Revenue and EBITDA grew in 9MFY25; operational performance to improve further in FY26 Strong promoter track record Weaknesses Inherent industry risks Detailed Description of Key Rating Drivers Comfortable Credit Metrics; Likely to Remain Stable in FY26: OBL maintained comfortable credit metrics during FY21-FY24, supported by its strong cash flow from operations. The gross interest coverage (EBITDA/ gross interest expense) remained strong in FY24, but despite lower interest expenses, the ratio declined to 10.78x in FY24 (FY23: 19.73x; FY22: 13.54x) because of a fall in EBITDA. During 9MFY25, the interest expense increased to around INR37 million, from the debt availed for the capex at the Dora facility. Following this, the gross interest coverage fell to around 5.81x in 9MFY25. However, the coverage is likely to improve in FY25 owing to an improvement in profitability in 4QFY25, as the tied-up projects are entering the final stages, when requirement of tiles would increase. The net leverage (net debt/ EBITDA) increased to 1.33x in FY24 (FY23: net cash positive, FY22: net cash positive) on account of debt availed for capex; however, the leverage is likely to improve over FY25-FY26 at the back of improved profitability. Change in Product Mix; Performance Likely to Improve in FY26: OBL’s product mix has witnessed a favourable change with the completion of capex to expand the capacity of glazed vitrified tiles (GVT) and the ongoing ramp-up of new capacities over FY25-FY26. The share of GVT in the sales volumes rose to 32% over FY24-9MFY25 (FY23: 23%), and the share of ceramics declined to 50% over the same period (56%). The revenue share of GVT increased to around 40% over FY24-9MFY25 (FY23: 30%). The share of ceramics declined to 42% in 9MFY25 (FY24: 43%, FY23: 50%). OBL is a leading tile manufacturer in India, with a mix of own and outsourced manufacturing. It has a country-wide supply chain and an omni-channel marketing model, with a wide variety of stock keeping units. With the shift in the product mix towards vitrified tiles, which has a higher average selling price per square meter, the topline and profitability are likely to improve over FY25-FY26. At end-December-2024, OBL had a strong distribution network, with over 2000-plus dealers and a retail network of 375 Orient Bell tiles showrooms (23 added during 9MFY25). The company has been focusing on and investing in its digital platform to improve B2C sales and improve its brand presence. The market has been impacted by competition in the domestic market, decline in exports, and the exports-related challenges being faced by players in the Morbi region, as reflected in the shutdown of various facilities in the area. This along with expenditure on marketing initiatives are likely to keep margins low in the near term. Ind-Ra believes the margins would improve over FY26, supported by growth in the GVT segment and improved market conditions in the Morbi region. Revenue and EBITDA Grew in 9MFY25; Operational Performance to Improve Further in FY26: OBL witnessed a turnaround in its performance in 9MFY25, with its revenue rising slightly to INR4,715 million (9MFY24: INR4,661 million) and its EBITDA increasing to INR215 million (INR113 million), driven by the improvement in the product mix, with a shift in focus towards GVT from ceramics. The sales volumes are likely to slightly moderate in FY25 but improve gradually from FY26, backed by the addition of capacities at Dora facility and stabilisation of capacity additions at other units. Consequently, OBL’s operating performance is likely to improve in FY26. Furthermore, the management plans to increase its brand presence with retail customers, for which it is spending on marketing initiatives. In FY24, OBL’s revenue had declined to INR6,745 million (FY23: INR7,051 million; FY22: INR6,543 million), led by lower realisations and volumes. The EBITDA fell sharply to INR209 million in FY24 (FY23: INR472 million; FY22: INR557 million) due to volatility in gas prices, increased competition and higher outlay on advertising expenses. The EBITDA margin fell to 3.1% in FY24 (6.7%; 8.5%). Strong Promoter Track Record: The agency has considered the strong track record of the management in running the business, along with the presence of experienced promoters and the resultant strong relationship with its clients.Inherent Industry Risks: The tiles sector is dependent on the real estate sector, which displays cyclical demand for building materials. The ceramic tiles industry is also dominated by intense competition from organised and unorganised sectors. Furthermore, the industry is dependent on natural gas, the rising prices of which can lead to volatility in the gross margins of players. Hence, the ability to manage the pass-through of volatile gas prices amid competition becomes a key rating monitorable. Also, the need to transport bulky raw material renders the company vulnerable to fluctuations in diesel prices. OBL has adopted various cost rationalisation measures, including the usage of alternate plant locations, job work and energy sources, to mitigate any negative impact of the volatility in natural gas prices. Liquidity Adequate: During the 12 months ended December 2024, the company’s monthly average utilisation of the fund-based limits was less than 2% and that of the non-fund-based limits was 23%. The liquidity is supported by cash flow from operations of INR384 million in FY24 (FY23: INR327 million; FY22: INR539 million), unencumbered cash balance of INR133 million (FY23: INR32 million, FY22: INR407 million), and adequate availability of unutilised fund-based limits. OBL’s free cash flows continued to be negative at INR262 million in FY24 (FY23: negative INR280 million; FY22: INR266 million) on account of the capex undertaken for expansion of its GVT operations over FY23-FY24. The free cash flows are likely to turn positive in FY25, backed by the absence of any major capex plans over the next one-to-two years and likely improvement in cash flows from newly added capacities. OBL's net working capital cycle was almost stable at 55 days in FY24 (FY23: 56 days, FY22: 51 days), with an increase in creditor days to 85 days (65,64), an increase in debtor days to 71 days (58, 58), and an increase in inventory to 68 days (64, 57), mainly on account of weak demand and supply glut in the Morbi cluster. The agency expects the net working capital cycle to remain largely stable over the medium term. OBL has scheduled debt repayments of INR115 million and INR137 million for FY26 and FY27, respectively, which will be serviced through internal cash accruals, with a debt service coverage ratio of 5.5x-6.0x in FY25 and 2.0-2.5x in FY26-FY27. Rating Sensitivities Positive: A substantial improvement in the scale of operations and profitability while maintaining the credit profile and adequate liquidity will be positive for the ratings. Negative: Deterioration in the scale of operations and/ or deterioration in liquidity, leading to the net adjusted leverage exceeding 2.0x will be negative for the ratings. About the Company OBL is engaged in the manufacturing, trading and selling of ceramic and vitrified tiles. The company has three owned manufacturing plants and two plants under a joint venture, all spread across Gujarat, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh. In FY24, the company had a total tile production capacity of 26.86msmpa, with 24.05msm sales volumes. OBL’s Sikandrabad (Bulandshahr) facility had a capacity of 14.8msmpa, Hoskote (Bangalore) facility had a capacity of 6.6msmpa and Dora (Bharuch- Gujarat) facility had a capacity of 5.46msmpa as on 31 December 2024.

Rating Rationale Rating Rationale April 19, 2025 | Mumbai Sudarshan Chemical Industries LimitedRating removed from 'Watch Developing'; Rating Reaffirmed Rating ActionRs.50 Crore Commercial PaperCrisil A1+ (Removed from 'Rating Watch with Developing Implications'; Rating Reaffirmed)Note: None of the Directors on Crisil Ratings Limited’s Board are members of rating committee and thus do not participate in discussion or assignment of any ratings. The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities Detailed Rationale Crisil Ratings rating on the commercial paper programme of Sudarshan Chemical Industries Limited (SCIL) has been removed from ‘Rating Watch with Developing Implications’ and reaffirmed at ‘Crisil A1+’. Earlier on October 22, 2024, the rating on commercial paper programme of SCIL was placed on ‘Rating Watch with developing implications’ following the announcement of a definitive agreement entered into by SCIL to acquire the global pigment operations of the Heubach group of Germany on a debt-free basis for a total consideration of EURO 127.5 million (approximately Rs 1,180 Crore) through its wholly owned subsidiary Sudarshan Europe B.V. (SEBV). The transaction includes acquisition of assets and share deal of Heubach group by SEBV. The transaction will trigger a mandatory open offer to public shareholders in accordance with the provisions of SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011 (“SEBI SAST Regulations, 2011”) for acquisition of up to 26% stake in Heubach’s group listed Indian entity, Heubach Colorants India Limited, entailing a maximum consideration of Rs. 346 crore. The acquisition has been funded through a mix of equity and debt. Accordingly, Sudharshan’s Board of Directors had approved a proposal for raising funds of Rs. 1,000 crore plus green shoe option up to 25% by way of issuance of equity shares or any other eligible securities (“Securities”) through permissible modes. On March 03, 2025, the company announced the completion of the acquisition of Global Pigment Business Operations of Heubach Group of Germany. The acquisition was completed through debt of around Rs. 1,600 crore (EURO 175 million) and equity raise of around Rs. 1,000 crore (includes Rs. 25 crore received out of warrants of Rs. 100 crore subscribed by promoter Mr. Rajesh Rathi; balance Rs. 75 crore expected over the next 18 months). The debt taken has 15-month moratorium with a ballooning repayment structure with repayment starting from September 2027. The 'Watch' resolution, along with the reaffirmation of the short-term rating, reflects the expectation that the company will maintain a sizeable corpus of unencumbered liquidity Rs. 800-850 crore over the medium term, until restructuring of the recently acquired business of Heubach group is completed. This liquidity is expected to provide adequate coverage for exceptional expenses expected during the turnaround phase and also act as a financial buffer, ensuring timely availability of additional funds in case of unforeseen exigencies. However, given the acquisition is materially large and also debt levels have risen, a material delay in turning around operations and improving profitability of Heubach group will be critical to sustain the company’s credit risk profile. Besides, incremental debt related to the transaction will impact key debt protection metrics over the near to medium term. Moreover, any imposition of reciprocal tariffs by US across different geographies will need to be closely monitored, as such developments could materially impact the company’s business volumes, pricing competitiveness, and overall profitability thereby exerting additional pressure on key debt metrics. Consequently, both the operational and financial recovery of the acquired business and evolving global trade dynamics will remain key monitorables. Revenue growth of the company’s existing business is expected to continue however, it may moderate owing to looming geo-political headwinds. While the operating margin of existing business will sustain at current level of around 13%, the consolidated operating margin is expected to reduce due to initial lower operating profitability of the Heubach Group, as well as post-acquisition spend on turnaround and re-optimsation of manufacturing operations. As a result, during initial period, the financial risk profile is expected to moderate to average levels, from earlier comfortable levels. Debt protection metrics will moderate considerably due to higher debt; adj. gearing to remain over 1.0 time over the medium term, while gross debt to operating profit before interest, taxes, depreciation & amortisation (OPBDIT) will peak at around 4 times during the turnaround phase (1.42 times as on March 31, 2024), as the value unlocking of synergies will accrue once the restructuring phase is completed. Interest cover is also seen at modest levels of just around 3 times over the medium-term. That said, the company is expected to maintain material liquidity buffer to cover for any exigency that may arise for business operations and for debt re-payment obligations. In the near to medium term the company is estimated to hold unencumbered liquid surplus of Rs. 800-850 crore. Incrementally, the company has also earmarked Rs. 350 crore to fund the open offer. Going forward, the accrual of synergy benefits through the turnaround strategy shall remain a key monitorable. The acquisition will help Sudharshan emerge as a leading global pigment company with a presence across 19 countries, as well as 17 manufacturing facilities in 11 countries. The Heubach group is the second largest player in the global pigment sector and is estimated to have reported revenues of close to around EURO 800 million. However, the Heubach group faced financial challenges recently, due to headwinds from the Ukraine-Russia conflict leading to high energy prices, which was followed by weak demand scenario in key European markets. This impacted profitability and along with high debt levels led to the group filing for bankruptcy. Post-acquisition, SCIL’s group revenues will witness a material increase with inclusion of Heubach group turnover and its market position in the pigments business will solidify. The rating also continues to reflect the extensive experience of the promoters in the pigment industry and the established market position of SCIL. The ratings also factor in the diversified product range and end-user industry and customer profile, strong distribution network and marquee clientele, and average financial risk profile supported by healthy financial flexibility. These strengths are partially offset by the working capital requirements, exposure to risks related to volatility in commodity prices, and weak profitability of the Heubach Group. For the first nine months of fiscal 2025, SCIL’s revenues increased by around 12% on-year to Rs. 1,996 crore, on the back of 17% on-year growth in pigment revenues, partially offset by the engineering division business i.e., RIECO Industries Ltd (RIECO) witnessed sharp decline in revenues during the said period (Rs. 146 crore revenue during the first nine months of fiscal 2025 as against Rs. 196 crore revenues during the corresponding period last fiscal). That said, REICO’s performance during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (Rs. 65 crore during 3Q’FY25 as against Rs. 45 crore during the same period of corresponding fiscal) has shown improvement compared to first half of fiscal 2025 (Rs. 81 crore during 1H’FY25 as against Rs. 151 crore during the same period of last fiscal) on the back of better execution of order book. The pigment division revenues accounted for around 93% of the total revenues of SCIL during the period ending December 31, 2024. Demand continued to be healthy in the first nine of the fiscal 2025, with pigment revenues increasing by 17% on-year to Rs. 1,850 crore on the back of 18% y-o-y growth in specialty pigments followed by 16% y-o-y growth in non-specialty pigments. The volume ramp-up from the recent completed growth capex coupled with healthy domestic demand and strong recovery in overseas markets, translated to healthy growth in pigment revenues. In terms of geographic mix, pigment revenues from domestic markets increased by around 7% y-o-y during the period ended December 2024 to Rs. 873 crore, and export revenues during the same period increased by 28% y-o-y to Rs. 977 crore. Operating margins improved 160 basis points (bps) during the nine-month ended December 31, 2024, to 13.2% on the back of improving product and geographic mix, and stable raw material prices. The volume ramp-up from recent completed growth capex pertaining to specialty pigments owing to favorable demand drivers, translated to the 160-bps operating margin expansion. Specialty pigment revenues as a percentage of total pigment revenues improved to 69% during the said period, as against, 68.5% during the same period of last fiscal, and overseas revenue mix as a percentage of total pigment revenues improved to 52.8% during the first nine months of fiscal 2025, as against 48.5% during the same period of last fiscal. Consequently, operating profitability increased by around 28% on-year to Rs. 263 crore. Analytical Approach Crisil Ratings has combined the business and financial risk profiles of SCIL and its subsidiaries, Sudarshan Europe B.V., Sudarshan North America, Inc., Sudarshan Shanghai Trading Company Ltd, Sudarshan Mexico S de R.L.de CV, Sudarshan Japan K.K., and Heubach Group including Heubach Colour Pvt Ltd, Heubach Pigments Pvt Ltd, and other Heubach companies. All these companies are collectively referred to as the Sudarshan group and have significant managerial, operational, and financial linkages. Crisil Ratings has also consolidated the business and financial risk profiles of RIECO Industries Ltd, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of SCIL and also because of the support committed by the group and its track record demonstrated earlier. In addition, the capital reserve generated from the transaction has been adjusted from networth. Please refer Annexure - List of entities consolidated, which captures the list of entities considered and their analytical treatment of consolidation. Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description Strengths: Healthy market position in the pigment industry SCIL is the largest pigment manufacturer in India, with a market share of around 33%, and as per company estimates, is the third largest pigment manufacturer in the world. The products are used in various end-user industries such as decorative and automotive coatings, plastics, inks, and cosmetics. The company, with a product base comparable to global leaders, aims to add more products to its portfolio. Its strong network comprises more than 60 channel partners and subsidiaries in the USA, the Netherlands, China, Mexico and Japan; for distribution of pigments worldwide & procurement of raw materials. Exports accounted for 53% of revenue during the nine months ended December 31, 2024. The company is likely to see its growth strengthen further including global market position, aided by new products launched as a part of capex program which is recently concluded and the “Go to Market” strategy initiative of the company post the easing macro-economic headwinds and global uncertainties. Tailwinds like ongoing consolidation in the industry and the China plus one strategy may also benefit the company. Currently, specialty pigments product portfolio accounts for around 69% of pigment business revenues, and the proportion is said to increase with new product launches within High Performance Pigments (HPPs) and Complex Inorganic Color Pigments (CICPs). The new products from the capex investments have higher skewness towards overseas markets, given the global shift toward specialty pigments Post-acquisition, Sudharshan’s group revenues will witness a material increase with inclusion of Heubach group turnover and its market position in the pigments business will solidify. The company will also emerge as a leading player in the global pigment industry. Average financial risk profile supported by healthy financial flexibility SCIL had undertaken a debt funded expansionary capex of Rs. 750 crore undertaken over fiscals 2020-23. As a result, adjusted gearing sharply increased from 0.87 time as on March 31, 2020, to 1.04 time as on March 31, 2023. However, following demand headwinds impacting capex ramp-up and profitability, the company’s debt to OPBDIT and adj. gearing peaked at 3.59 times and 1.05 times respectively as on March 31, 2023. During fiscal 2024, the company had monetised freehold land, and the proceeds of Rs. 287 crore (net of tax) were utilised towards the reduction of high-cost borrowings and prepayment of external commercial borrowings (ECB); as a result, adj. gearing and debt to OPBDIT improved to 0.42 time and 1.42 time as on March 31, 2024. However, as a result of the large debt funded acquisition, SCIL’s financial risk profile is expected to moderate to average levels from earlier comfortable levels. Adj. gearing is expected to remain over 1.0 time over fiscal 2026-28, and debt to OPBDIT to also peak at around 4 times during fiscal 2026-27, before gradually improving to below 1.0 time and 2.0 times respectively post fiscal 2028. Interest cover is expected to remain over 3 times in the medium term. Going forward, the improvement in leverage will be driven by value unlocking of synergies, subsequent to the completion of the turnaround exercise. The company is nevertheless expected to maintain sufficient liquidity cover in the form of unencumbered cash and unutilised bank lines to cover business operations and support debt re-payment obligations, in the event of insufficient accruals. In addition, the company has a strong relationship with the lenders and hence shall be able to raise sufficient funds in case of exigency. Weaknesses: Return metrics and operating margins to be temporarily impacted owing to the acquisition of stressed Heubach Group Operating margins will contract considerably post full, year consolidation of the Heubach Group pigment operations and factoring in expenses related to post-merger and re-optimsation of manufacturing operations. The execution of the turnaround strategy shall be critical to ensure operating margins and return on capital employed (RoCE) return to healthy levels of 9-10% and over 10-12% respectively. Large working capital requirement and susceptibility to volatility in raw material prices Gross current assets (GCA; net of cash) days stood at 176 days as on September 30, 2024 (164 days as on March 31, 2024). Inventory requirement remains high as the company has multiple stock keeping units for pigments and several distribution centers both in India and abroad. That said, while GCA days (net of cash) is high, the net working capital cycle stood moderate at around 20 days as on September 30, 2024 (as against 38 days as on March 31, 2024). The sustenance of the net working capital cycle of around 25-35 days shall keep working capital intensity limited and thereby resulting in limited reliance on external funding. However, SCIL’s operating profitability margins remain susceptible to volatility in raw material prices such as benzene, toluene, naphthalene, and liner low density polyethylene, which are essentially crude linked. Sharp increase in key raw material prices over fiscal 2022-23 resulted in operating profitability margins to contract to around 12.7% during fiscal 2022 and 10.0% during fiscal 2023 from over 13% in the previous fiscal years. That said, cost plus model pertaining to straight pass through of commodity inflation, limits the impact of sharp increases in raw material prices. Liquidity: Strong Expected annual net cash accrual of Rs. 200-350 crore along with expected unencumbered cash surplus of Rs. 800-850 crore over the medium term, shall be sufficient to meet yearly debt repayment obligations of Rs. 170-350 crore (stepped up repayment structure) and capital expenditure spends of Rs. 200-250 crore between fiscals 2026-2028. Also, the company has access to fund-based limits of Rs. 515 crore (average 12 months drawing power is Rs. 360 crore), which on-average during the past six months through to February 2025 has been utilised to the tune of 46%. ESG Profile Crisil Ratings believes that the Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) profile of SCIL supports its existing strong credit risk profile. The chemical sector has a high impact on the environment because of the high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, high hazardous waste generation by its core operations. The sector has a social impact because of its large workforce, the impact on the health and wellbeing of its workers and the local community on account of its nature of operations. Sudarshan Chemical Industries Ltd has continuously focused on mitigating its environmental and social impact. SCIL’s Key ESG highlights: SCIL has set a target to reduce Green House Gases (GHG) emissions by 42% by fiscal 2032 from its fiscal 2021 baseline. Also, the company plans to attain zero waste to landfill by fiscal 2032. Further it has set a target to decrease specific water consumption by 20% by fiscal 2026 from its 2021 baseline. In fiscal 2024, its specific water intensity reduced by around 40% to 32.54 KL per crore of revenue, in line with its target. SCIL’s lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) stood at nil for employees and 0.58x for workers in fiscal 2024, higher than the previous fiscal (reported nil LTIFR for workforce). There is growing importance of ESG among investors and lenders. SCIL’s commitment to ESG principles will play a key role in enhancing stakeholder confidence, given its share of overseas borrowings in its overall debt and access to both domestic and foreign capital markets. Rating sensitivity factors Downward factors Any significant decline in revenue and operating profitability of the acquired businesses resulting in overall operating margin remaining in mid-single digit for a prolonged period thereby impacting annual cash accruals. Substantial increase in working capital requirement or debt-funded capex, leading to delay in expected correction of key debt protection metrics i.e. net debt-to-EBITDA remaining above 3 times at end of fiscal 2027. Faster than expected depletion in unencumbered liquidity due to large dividend payout or higher-than-expected post-acquisition expenses expected to be incurred over the near to medium term. About the Company SCIL is a globally renowned pigment player and the largest in India, manufacturing a wide range of organic and inorganic pigments and mica-based effect pigments. The company, which was established in 1951, remained focused on the domestic market till 2006. The joint venture with Dainippon Ink Corporation (DIC) was operational between 1990 and 2006, post which SCIL went global, establishing its footprint in North America Europe and other geographies. The company has two manufacturing facilities in Roha and Mahad (both in Maharashtra). During the nine months ended December 31, 2024, Sudharshan registered a profit after tax of Rs. 60 crore (Rs. 294 crore in corresponding period of fiscal 2024, which also includes exceptional income pertaining to the gain on sale of freehold land) on net sales of Rs. 1,996 crore (Rs.1,775 crore). Promoter shareholding as on January 31, 2025 stood at 24.28% (27.55% as on December 31, 2024) with recent change in shareholding due to equity raise, and open market sale by some of the promoters.

Rationale
Material event:
The board of directors of SML Isuzu Limited (SML), in their meeting held on April 26, 2025, provided in-principal approval for
the following transactions:
• Mahindra & Mahindra Limited (M&M) has entered into a share purchase agreement to acquire 6,362,306 equity
shares representing 43.96% of the equity share capital of SML from Sumitomo Corporation (Sumitomo), subject to
satisfaction of customary conditions precedent (including, but not limited to, receipt of approval from Competition
Commission of India (“CCI”)). The total consideration for the purchase is ~Rs. 414 crore.
• M&M has also entered into a share purchase agreement to acquire 2,170,747 equity shares representing 15% of the
equity share capital of SML from Isuzu Motors Limited, Japan (Isuzu), subject to satisfaction of customary conditions
precedent (including, but not limited to, receipt of approval from Competition Commission of India (“CCI”)). The total
consideration for the purchase is ~Rs.141 crore.
• The overall stake acquisition for M&M from Sumitomo and Isuzu will be for their entire combined stake of 59%.
The transactions remain subject to requisite stakeholder/regulatory approvals and also comes alongside an open offer by
M&M to acquire an additional 26% stake in SML Isuzu Limited from public shareholders at Rs. 1554.6 per share, amounting to
Rs. 585 crore if fully subscribed.
Impact of the material event
The long-term rating for SML Isuzu has been placed on watch with positive implications as the aforesaid development is likely
to have a favourable impact on the credit profile of SML Isuzu, the extent of which would be ascertained over a period of time,
given the nascent stage of developments and the dependence on various stakeholder/regulatory approvals and market
dynamics. The change in ownership of the entity to M&M, when it materialises, is likely to aid SML’s product
development/network expansion plans over the medium term, aided by M&M’s well-established position in the automotive
sector. Accordingly, the developments are expected to be a credit positive in ICRA’s view. ICRA would continue to monitor the
developments related to the transaction/open offer, and take appropriate rating action, post analysing the impact of the same
on SML Isuzu’s credit profile.

Parent Company: Sumitomo Corporation, Japan.
ICRA expects the parent entity, Sumitomo Corporation (a 43.96% stake) to be willing to
Parent/Group support extend financial support to SML out of its need to protect its reputation from the
consequences of a group entity's distress. The Managing director and three other board
members of SML are representatives of Sumitomo Corporation.

Total 314.76 332.60
*Instrument details are provided in Annexure-I
Rationale
The reaffirmation of ratings factors in the steady operational performance of JTEKT India Limited (JIL), with the company being
a leading supplier of steering systems to passenger vehicle (PV) original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in India. The
reaffirmed ratings continue to factor in the company’s healthy financial risk profile characterised by low leverage and healthy
cash accruals, as well as operational and technical support enjoyed by it from its parent company, JTEKT Corporation (JTEKT),
Japan. Going forward, the steady operational performance is expected to aid the company in generating healthy cash accruals
and help it maintain a strong credit profile.
JIL enjoys a leading position in the steering system segment in India with a strong presence in manual steering gears (MSG),
electronic power steering (EPS) and hydraulic power steering systems (HPS). Besides the steering systems division, the
company has a driveline division for manufacturing axle assemblies, case differentials and propellant shafts, resulting in a
diversified product profile for the entity. Moreover, the company has recently developed a new product, constant velocity
joints (CVJ), to expand its driveline division, which would support its revenue growth in the medium term and further diversify
its product portfolio.
JIL continues to maintain a healthy share of the business (SoB) with some of the leading PV OEMs in India, including Maruti
Suzuki India Limited (MSIL), Mahindra & Mahindra Limited (M&M), Honda Cars India Limited (HCIL) and Toyota Kirloskar Motor
Private Limited (TKML), providing healthy revenue visibility.
The ratings continue to factor in the marketing and technical support received by JIL from JTEKT, a leading global manufacturer
of steering systems and driveline products. In addition, its strong parentage lends the company healthy financial flexibility, in
terms of access to unsecured debt from Japanese banks (backed by corporate guarantee from the parent entity).
JIL reported moderate revenue growth of ~7% YoY to Rs. 1,613.4 crore in 9M FY2024 (due to the high base of 9M FY2023) and
reported an OPM of 9.0%, aided by steady underlying demand in the PV industry. Its credit metrics remained healthy with a
total debt/ OPBITDA of 0.6 times and interest cover of ~36.5 times in 9M FY2024. JIL maintains a healthy financial risk profile,
aided by healthy cash accruals, low debt repayments and moderate capex plans. Going forward, its credit metrics are expected
www.icra .in 1
Page |
to remain comfortable aided by the company’s healthy cash accruals, despite having capex plans of Rs. 120-150 crore in
FY2024. The management is evaluating plans to set up a new greenfield plant to enhance capacity, factoring in the healthy
demand outlook for the PV industry over the medium term; the funding mix for setting up the new plant, once finalised, will
remain monitorable.
ICRA notes that the company has amalgamated its subsidiary company, JTEKT Fuji Kiko Automotive Limited with and into JIL
(effective from January 01, 2024), which is likely to help the company achieve operational efficiencies.
The ratings remain constrained by the competitive intensity in the steering system space and JIL’s segment concentration risks.
JIL’s business profile is characterised by a high concentration in the domestic PV industry and dependence on select OEMs.
Going forward, JIL’s revenue growth is expected to remain broadly in line with the growth in the PV industry while being
supported by incremental revenues from the CVJ business.
The Stable outlook on the long-term rating reflects ICRA’s expectation that JIL will continue maintaining a robust credit profile,
aided by strong technological support from its parent entity, as well as JIL’s dominant position in the supply of steering systems
to the domestic PV industry.
Key rating drivers and their description
Credit strengths
Leading manufacturer of steering systems in India with strong SoB with PV OEMs - The company is a leading manufacturer
of steering systems in the domestic market, with a high SoB with several PV OEMs such as MSIL, M&M, HCIL and TKML. The
company enjoys a SoB of ~50-55% with the market leader, MSIL, and nearly 100% for its product supplies to TKML (benefitting
from being a part of the Toyota Group). The strong SoB with various OEMs provides healthy revenue visibility for the company.
Strong parentage provides technical support and aids JIL in securing business from Japanese OEMs in India - JIL receives
business and technical support from JTEKT, a leading global manufacturer of steering systems and driveline products. In
addition, its strong parentage lends the company healthy financial flexibility, in the form of access to unsecured debt from
Japanese banks (backed by corporate guarantee from the parent entity for some sanctions).
Well-diversified product offerings of steering system and driveline products - The company has diverse product offerings,
including CEPS, HPS, MSG and driveline products such as axle assemblies, case differentials, propellant shafts. JIL has also
developed CVJs, which has helped it to enhance its product profile and diversify its business profile for the driveline division.
Healthy financial risk profile, characterised by low leverage and healthy cash accruals – JIL has a healthy financial risk profile,
characterised by a conservative capital structure and strong debt coverage indicators. Its financial risk profile is also supported
by its adequate liquidity position, characterised by the availability of unutilised working capital limits and surplus cash and
liquid balances (~Rs. 75 crore as of March 2024). Going forward, although the company has moderate capex plans of ~Rs. 120-
150 crore in FY2025, its reliance on debt is expected to remain low aided by its healthy cash accruals. Accordingly, the
company’s credit metrics and coverage indicators are expected to remain healthy over the medium term.
Credit challenges
High segment concentration risk with PV sector driving ~95% of sales, exposes JIL to demand vagaries of domestic PV market
- JIL generates ~95% of its revenues from PV OEMs, resulting in significant segment concentration risk and making it susceptible
to the cyclicality in the PV industry. Nevertheless, the company’s favourable ownership pattern, coupled with the healthy SoB
enjoyed with various OEMs, mitigates the segment concentration risk to an extent.
Increasing competition in the steering systems market, especially in supplies to key customer, MSIL - JIL encounters stiff
competition from other steering system manufacturers, which has led to the loss of business for a few key models in the past.
Nevertheless, the company maintains a strong SoB with various OEMs and has been able to gain business for recent product
www.icra .in 2
Page |
launches of various OEMs. Going forward, the company’s access to technological know-how from its parent entity is expected
to help it maintain its strong market position.
Environmental and Social Risks
Environmental considerations: Even as JIL is not directly exposed to the climate-transition risks from a likelihood of tightening
emission control requirements, with its products being used across different fuel powertrains, its automotive manufacturing
customers remain highly exposed to the same. Accordingly, JIL’s prospects are linked to its customer’s ability to meet
tightening emission requirements. The company’s exposure to litigation/penalties from issues related to waste and water
management remains relatively lower.
Social considerations: JIL, like most automotive-component suppliers, has a healthy dependence on human capital and
retaining human capital, maintaining healthy employee relations and its supplier ecosystem remain essential for disruption-
free operations of the entity. Moreover, JIL encounters product safety and quality-related social risks, wherein instances of
product recall and high warranty costs may lead to financial implications and harm its reputation, creating a more long-lasting
adverse impact. In this regard, JIL’s strong track record in catering to leading automotive manufacturers underscores its ability
to mitigate these risks to an extent. The company’s strong technological capabilities, aided by support from JTEKT Corporation
(Japan), are likely to help it align its products with any changes in customer preferences.
Liquidity position: Adequate
JIL’s liquidity position is adequate, supported by healthy cash flow generation, availability of unutilised working capital limits
(average unutilised limit of ~Rs. 125 crore against the sanctioned limits during the 12-month period that ended in February
2024), access to undrawn term loans of ~Rs. 60 crore as of March 2024 and surplus cash and liquid balances (~Rs. 75 crore as
of March 2024). In addition, the parentage of JTEKT provides the entity with strong financial flexibility and gives it access to
unsecured sanctions from Japanese banks at competitive interest rates. Against the aforementioned liquidity position, the
company has minimal debt repayments of ~Rs. 26 crore and capex plans of ~Rs. 120-150 crore in FY2025. Going forward, it is
expected to largely meet its capex requirements and debt obligations from internal accruals and available lines of credit while
maintaining healthy cash surpluses.
Rating sensitivities
Positive factors – A sustained diversification of the company’s segmental, product or customer mix would be favourably
considered for an upgrade. Significant improvement in the company’s return indicators and debt coverage indicators on a
sustained basis would also augur well for an upgrade.
Negative factors – The ratings may be revised downwards, in case of any significant deterioration in the company’s profitability
and credit metrics on account of weakness in demand across the domestic automotive industry, or due to any large debt-
funded capex, which adversely impacts its credit profile. Any weakening of the technical and operational linkages with the
parent company could also trigger a negative rating action. Net debt/OPBDITA above 1.0 times on a sustained basis is also a
specific factor for a downgrade.

About the company
JTEKT India Limited (JIL; erstwhile Sona Koyo Steering Systems Limited) is a leading manufacturer of steering systems and
driveline products for passenger vehicle OEMs in India. The company commands a market leadership position in the steering
system segment in India with a strong SoB with OEMs, including Maruti Suzuki India Limited (MSIL), Mahindra & Mahindra
(M&M), Honda Cars India Limited (HCIL), Toyota Kirloskar Motor Private Limited (TKML) and Tata Motors Limited (TML). JIL is
a domestic-focused auto component manufacturer and generates ~95-96% of its revenues from PV OEMs.
The company manufactures the entire range of steering systems and driveline products. The key manufactured components
include manual and power steering systems, which comprise steering gears and columns. The driveline product portfolio
includes case differentials, axle components, rear axle assemblies, propeller shafts and constant velocity joints (CVJ, new
product). JIL supplies these products to various passenger vehicle OEMs. The company’s manufacturing facilities are located
in Gurgaon (Haryana), Dharuhera (Haryana) and Chennai.
The entity was incorporated in 1984 by the Sona Group, as a technical and financial collaboration with JTEKT Corporation,
Japan. In Q4 FY2017, JIL’s technology partner, JTEKT, bought out a 25.12% stake from its exiting Indian partner, Sona Autocomp
Holding Limited, and increased its shareholding in the company to 45.4% from 20.1%. It acquired a further 25% stake in JIL via
a public open offer in Q1 FY2018. At present, JTEKT’s stake in the company stands at 69.55% with two entities (JTEKT
Corporation and JTEKT Column Systems Corporation) combined.
The company amalgamated its subsidiary, JTEKT Sona Automotive India (JSAI), with effect from Q4 FY2019. This amalgamation
helped in streamlining the manufacturing operations, reducing overall production turnaround time. Moreover, it provides a
unified interface to customers, including access to an entire steering assembly offering from a single source, besides improving
efficiencies and reducing costs.
The company has amalgamated its subsidiary company, JTEKT Fuji Kiko Automotive Limited with and into JIL (effective from
January 01, 2024), which has helped the company to rationalise the overhead expenses and optimally utilise its available
resources.

The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities*Issuer did not cooperate; based on best-available information Please note that the rating(s) are based on best available information with the credit rating agency: the entity whose debt is being published via this rating rationale did not provide the requisite information needed to conduct the rating exercise or did not provide the No Default Statements (NDS) for the last three months and is therefore classified as 'non cooperative'. Non cooperation by Issuer Crisil Ratings has been consistently following up with Deep Industries (DI) for obtaining information through letter and email dated March 12, 2025 among others, apart from telephonic communication. However, the issuer has remained non cooperative. ‘The investors, lenders and all other market participants should exercise due caution with reference to the rating assigned/reviewed with the suffix 'ISSUER NOT COOPERATING' as the rating is arrived at without any management interaction and is based on best available or limited or dated information on the company. Such non co-operation by a rated entity may be a result of deterioration in its credit risk profile. These ratings with 'ISSUER NOT COOPERATING' suffix lack a forward looking component.’ Detailed Rationale Despite repeated attempts to engage with the management, Crisil Ratings failed to receive any information on either the financial performance or strategic intent of DI, which restricts Crisil Ratings’ ability to take a forward looking view on the entity's credit quality. Crisil Ratings believes that rating action on DI is consistent with ‘Assessing Information Adequacy Risk’. Based on the last available information, the ratings on bank facilities of DI continues to be ‘Crisil B+/Stable/Crisil A4 Issuer not cooperating’. About the Company Established in 2002 as a partnership firm by Mr. Dinkar Thakkar and his family members, DI manufactures industrial paints at its facility in Kutch. Any other information: Not applicable Note on complexity levels of the rated instrument: Crisil Ratings` complexity levels are assigned to various types of financial instruments and are included (where applicable) in the 'Annexure - Details of Instrument' in this Rating Rationale. Crisil Ratings will disclose complexity level for all securities - including those that are yet to be placed - based on available information.

Rating Rationale Rating Rationale October 04, 2024 | Mumbai Astra Microwave Products LimitedRatings reaffirmed at 'CRISIL A/Stable/CRISIL A1'; Rated amount enhanced for Bank Debt Rating ActionTotal Bank Loan Facilities RatedRs.1186.5 Crore (Enhanced from Rs.956 Crore)Long Term RatingCRISIL A/Stable (Reaffirmed)Short Term RatingCRISIL A1 (Reaffirmed)  Corporate Credit RatingCRISIL A/Stable (Reaffirmed)Note: None of the Directors on CRISIL Ratings Limited’s Board are members of rating committee and thus do not participate in discussion or assignment of any ratings. The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities Detailed Rationale CRISIL Ratings has reaffirmed its ‘CRISIL A/Stable/CRISIL A1’ ratings on the bank facilities and corporate credit rating of Astra Microwave Products Ltd (AMPL). The ratings factor in the healthy financial risk profile of the company, driven by healthy capital structure, strong networth and comfortable debt protection metrics. Business performance is expected to sustain in fiscal 2025, with revenue expected to grow 15% on-year (in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, revenue grew by 16% on-year to Rs 155 crore) and operating margin to sustain at 19-20% (15.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 vs 2.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2024) led by healthy order book of Rs 2,100 crore as on June 30, 2024, and increased contribution of the higher margin domestic business. Share of the domestic business is expected to increase to ~80% of revenue in fiscal 2025 from 65-70%. The share of the domestic business is expected to remain high above 75% in fiscal 2025. Revenue grew by 11% on-year to Rs 909 crore in fiscal 2024 on the back of healthy order intake and steady execution. Operating margin improved by around 310 basis points (bps) to 21.5% in fiscal 2024 owing to favourable geographical mix towards higher margin domestic order execution as against export orders. Share of revenue from the domestic market improved to 68% in fiscal 2024 from 60% in fiscal 2023. Domestic operations comprise higher margin orders owing to the proprietary nature of products developed and manufactured by AMPL, compared with export orders which are primarily of contract manufacturing. The financial risk profile was strong supported by healthy networth, with the completion of equity raise of Rs 225 crore through qualified institutional placement (QIP) in May 2024, proceeds of which were utilised for meeting working capital requirement. The capital structure continued to be healthy in fiscal 2024, with high cash accrual. Cash accrual is projected above Rs 120 crore per annum against Rs 22-25 crore debt obligation over the medium term. Leverage ratios as indicated by total outside liabilities to adjusted networth (TOLANW) and debt to adjusted networth (gearing) stood at 0.51 time and 0.25 time, respectively, as on March 31, 2024, and are expected to remain below 0.6 time and 0.4 time, respectively, over the medium term backed by healthy cash accrual. Key debt protection metrics will remain healthy, with interest coverage ratio expected above 6 times over the medium term. Financial flexibility is supported by unencumbered cash and equivalent of Rs 75 crore as on March 31, 2024. Capital expenditure (capex) of Rs 50-75 crore per annum, planned over the medium term, will likely be funded through debt and internal accrual. The ratings continue to reflect the established market position of AMPL in microwave radio frequency (RF) applications segment in India, its strategic importance as a qualified vendor for defence research establishments, strong customer relationships, healthy order pipeline and comfortable financial risk profile. These strengths are partially offset by large working capital requirement, susceptibility to risks inherent in tender-based business and long gestation period of projects. Analytical Approach CRISIL Ratings has combined the business and financial risk profile of AMPL, Bhavyabhanu Electronics Pvt Ltd (BEPL), Aelius Semiconductors Pte Ltd (ASPL) and Astra Space Technologies Pvt Ltd (ASTPL). The companies, collectively referred to as the AMPL group, have common ownership, management and strong business synergies. CRISIL Ratings has also moderately consolidated the joint venture, Astra Rafael Comsys Pvt Ltd, citing operational and financial linkages. Please refer Annexure - List of Entities Consolidated, which captures the list of entities considered and their analytical treatment of consolidation. Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description Strengths: Established market position, supported by strong in-house capability in the microwave RF applications domain, healthy customer relationships and growth prospects for the sector: The AMPL group derives its core business strength from its in-house capability to provide customised microwave RF solutions. It has five state-of-the-art facilities around Hyderabad, with research and development (R&D) capability for microwave RF applications, test equipment and environment chambers for space applications. It has set up an R&D facility in Bengaluru to manufacture radars. Over the years, the group has diversified its portfolio by providing microwave applications in the space and civil telecommunication segments. It has longstanding relationships with its customers and is recognised as a qualified vendor by defence research establishments. Its laboratories for testing space applications are acknowledged by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The group has been taking steps to move up the value chain from sub-systems vendor to system vendor and has identified growth areas such as SATCOM (satellite communications) systems, wind profiler radars, ground surveillance radars, doppler weather radars and anti-drone systems. The company has established a new facility in Bengaluru to cater to space technologies (such as satellites). Extensive and continued government focus on indigenisation in the defence sector with initiatives such as Make in India and imports embargo augurs well for the group. Healthy order pipeline offering sound revenue visibility: As on June 30, 2024, the company had orders worth Rs 2,099 crore to be executed over the next 24 months. Orders from the domestic market account for around 78% of the order book, with majority coming from the defence sector. The company’s management has been focussing on increasing domestic orders and execution as they have higher margins compared with export orders. Domestic revenue contribution stood at 82% during fiscal 2019, which declined to 53% in fiscal 2022 before improving to 68% in fiscal 2024. Over the medium term, the management aims to increase domestic revenue contribution to around 80%. In addition, AMPL is focussing on expanding order intake and revenue contribution from space projects, for which the company has set up a wholly owned subsidiary with a dedicated team focussing on expanding the space product portfolio. Furthermore, order intake over the medium term will be supported by initiatives taken by the government of India in the recent years, such as Atmanirbhar Bharath and Make in India campaigns, and announcement of positive indigenous list for defence products. Comfortable financial risk profile: The financial risk profile remains strong backed by healthy networth of Rs 963 crore and low gearing of 0.21 time as on March 31, 2024. The company primarily relies on short-term borrowing to fund its working capital requirement. Owing to net working capital cycle of over 400 days along with increase in scale of operations and decline in customer advances, the working capital borrowing increased from Rs 167 crore as on March 31, 2023, to Rs 216 crore as on March 31, 2024. The company has maintained TOL ANW ratio below 1.0 time despite large working capital requirement. The TOLANW is expected to remain below 0.6 time over the medium term on account of healthy operating margin and steady accrual. Debt protection metrics will likely remain healthy, with interest coverage above 6 times over the medium term. Weaknesses: Large working capital requirement: Gross current assets (GCAs; net of cash) were over 400 days as on March 31, 2024. AMPL primarily caters to the defence and aerospace industry, leading to delayed customer clearances and large inventory owing to medium to high gestation products. The GCAs (net of cash) are expected to remain above 400 days over the medium term owing to increasing domestic orders as against export orders, which not only have a longer production cycle but also a longer receivables cycle. The working capital cycle may remain stretched over the medium term and hence will be closely monitored. Susceptibility to risks inherent in tender-based business and long gestation period of projects: The business depends on success in bidding for tenders invited by defence public sector undertakings and research establishments. Establishments such as the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) invite tenders from qualified vendors for their R&D requirement and commence bulk production on successful completion of product development. Long-term revenue visibility is driven by the success of R&D projects at DRDO and mass production. Liquidity: Adequate Expected cash accrual over Rs 110 crore per annum over the medium term, along with unencumbered cash surplus of Rs 76 crore as on March 31, 2024, will sufficiently cover debt obligation of Rs 22-25 crore over fiscals 2025 and 2026. Yearly capex of Rs 50-75 crore is expected to be funded through debt and equity. Working capital is largely funded through internal accrual, customer advances and external debt. High bank limit utilisation remains monitorable. Outlook: Stable AMPL will continue to benefit from its healthy order book, improving geographical mix and sound operating efficiency. The financial risk profile will remain comfortable driven by healthy capital structure and comfortable debt protection metrics. Rating sensitivity factors Upward factors: Better-than-expected ramp-up in revenue and operating profitability leading to return on capital employed (RoCE) of 15-16% on a sustained basis Significant reduction in GCAs aiding liquidity Sustenance of healthy financial risk profile Downward factors: Weakening of business performance or decline in operating margin on a sustained basis Weakening of the financial risk profile owing to higher-than-anticipated debt or further stretch in the working capital cycle, with TOLANW ratio of 1.1-1.2 times on a sustained basis About the Company AMPL was incorporated as a private limited company in 1991 and reconstituted as a public limited company in 1993. It is promoted by Mr P A Chitrakar, Ms C Pramelamma and Mr B Malla Reddy. The company designs, develops and manufactures customised sub-systems and components for microwave communication systems used in defence, space and telecommunication sectors. In fiscal 2014, AMPL floated the 100% owned BEPL as a captive supplier of raw material for overseas orders. In fiscal 2015, AMPL floated the 100% owned ASPL in Singapore as a supplier of monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) products for semiconductors. In fiscal 2019, AMPL set up a joint venture, Astra Rafael Comsys Pvt Ltd, with Rafael Advanced Defence Systems for production of communication systems and sub-systems for defence. AMPL has incorporated ASTPL as a wholly owned subsidiary, which will cater to the requirement of space and satellite technologies. In the three months ended June 30, 2024, the company generated revenue of Rs 155 crore and profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 15 crore compared with Rs 134 crore of revenue and net loss of Rs 1 crore in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal.

A no-objection certificate has been received from the banker. Analytical Approach Ind-Ra continues to take a standalone view of Rossell to arrive at the ratings. Detailed Rationale of the Rating Action The affirmation reflects Rossell’s established position in the tea business with a track record of more than three decades and a share of around 2% of the country’s total orthodox tea production (source: Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy). After an exceptionally weak performance in FY24, Rossell’s EBITDA is likely to recover in FY25, primarily on the back of a rise in tea prices and a marginal increase in sale volumes.  However, an increase in wage rates without a commensurate increase (or a moderation) in tea prices from the highs of 8MFY25 (up around 20% yoy) could lead to a decline in EBITDA from the existing operations in FY26.The acquisition of the Dhoedaam tea estate, which was completed on 1 January 2025, is likely to increase Rossell’s sale volumes by around 35% yoy in FY26. However, the tea estate’s contribution to the EBITDA is likely to be limited in the near term, but the company has undertaken measures to gradually improve productivity and reduce costs over the medium term. The completion of the demerger with Rossell Techsys Ltd (the aerospace division) has reduced the scale of Rossell’s EBITDA below the rating category medians, but it also made it a net cash company in FY24. However, the increase in net debt in FY25 would lead to weaker-than-expected credit metrics over the near term as the increase in sustainable EBITDA would not be commensurate with the rise in debt. The ratings continue to benefit from Rossell’s adequate liquidity position. List of Key Rating Drivers Strengths Established position in tea business Tea recovers in 1HFY25 after sharp deterioration in FY24; rise in wage cost could impact EBITDA in FY26 Net cash position after completion of demerger of aerospace business Adequate liquidity provides some cushion against industry cyclicality Weaknesses Demerger reduces scale to half, diversification lost Net debt likely to rise in FY25; medium-term de-leveraging contingent on EBITDA growth Seasonality and cyclicality inherent in tea industry Detailed Description of Key Rating Drivers Established Position in Tea Business:  Rossell is an established producer of bulk tea in India, with a track record of more than three decades and a share of 2%-3% of the country’s total orthodox tea production. Rossell owns six tea estates, spread over a cultivable area of 2,646 hectares (ha); of these, five estates can produce both CTC and orthodox varieties, depending on the market dynamics. Furthermore, in January 2025, the company completed the acquisition of Assam-based Dhoedaam tea estate, which would increase the area by around 35%.  The company's tea commands a premium over the average north India auction prices, reflecting its superior quality in both CTC and orthodox segments. Rossell’s replanting policy has kept the average age profile of its bushes to under 50 years, leading to a yield of around 1,900kg/ha over the past few years. This has supported its operating efficiency and margin profile, given the fixed cost-intensive cost structure and limited the dependence on bought leaf operations to single digits. While the yields declined sharply in FY24 owing to weather issues and pest infestation, a recovery is likely in FY25. Exports rose sharply to 0.9 million kg in FY24 (FY23: 0.63 million kg), accounting for 17% of the total tea sales (FY23: 11%), with the company having long-standing relationships with renowned tea brands globally. Tea Recovers in 1HFY25 after Sharp Deterioration in FY24; Rise in Wage Cost could Impact EBITDA in FY26:  The tea business’s revenue fell to INR1,497million in FY24 (FY23: INR1,672 million) owing to a fall in prices as well as a decline in the company’s tea production. While India’s tea production inched up to 1,382 million kg in FY24 (FY23: 1,375 million kg), Rossell’s own production fell 10% yoy to 4.9 million kg due to a combination of inadequate rainfall in upper Assam, where two-third of its estates are located, and increased pest infestation.  India’s tea production dipped in 8MFY25, and this combined with a rise in exports led to a surge in tea prices. However, Rossell’s sales volumes recovered to 4.4 million kg in 8MFY25 (8MFY24: 4.1 million kg, 8MFY23: 4.4 million kg), while its realisations rose nearly 20% yoy to around INR347/kg.In FY24, the EBITDA declined by around 70% yoy to INR57 million in FY24 due to weak revenue and increase in wage cost. However, the EBITDA recovered in 1HFY25, rising to INR418 million (1HFY24: INR239 million), as prices rose, and sale volumes increased. The EBITDA, however, remained slightly lower compared to 1HFY23 levels owing to the impact of a gradual wage increase over the period and lower production of own leaf.  Tea companies usually incur losses in the second half of the year owing to seasonality-related factors, resulting in higher fixed costs. However, despite the additional expense towards Dhoedaam, Ind-Ra expects Rossell’s EBITDA to witness yoy improvement in FY25 because of rise in tea prices.Tea is a fixed cost-intensive business, with employee cost accounting for over two-thirds of the total cost (FY24: 67%). This leads to an inherent volatility, as the biggest cost component does not move in tandem with product prices. The state government had announced hikes in daily wages annually over 2021-2023. The basic daily wages of the tea estate workers in Assam were increased by 8% in October 2023. While no wage rate revision has been announced in 2024, Ind-Ra believes a similar increase could be announced in 2025, increasing Rossell’s cost of production. Ind-Ra expects the lower production to support prices in FY25, but the sustainability of the elevated prices in FY26 will be contingent on the India’s output as well as export demand, which would be a function of the global demand supply dynamics. An increase in wage rates without a commensurate increase in tea prices or a moderation in tea prices could hit EBITDA. The newly acquired Dhoedaam tea estate generated revenue of INR295 million in FY24 and has the potential to produce an average of around 1.8 million kg. While the historical profitability of the estate is not available, the Dhoedaam tea estate constituted around one-fourth of the total revenue of the selling entity (James Warren Tea Ltd), which reported EBITDA losses in FY24 (FY23: INR15 million) and profit of less than INR100 million for a major portion of the past decade. Rossell plans to implement various initiatives to improve productivity, quality and reduce costs over the next two-to-three years, and it is likely to achieve its potential EBITDA only in the medium term. The ability of the estate to generate sustained healthy profitability will be a key monitorable. Net Cash Position after Completion of Demerger of Aerospace Business: The demerger of Rossell’s aerospace (Techsys) business into a separate entity became effective as of August 2024 (appointed date: 1 April 2023). The company had filed for a scheme of demerger of the aerospace business from the tea business in December 2022. which involved the creation of a separate entity (Rossell Techsys Ltd) for the aerospace division with the same shareholding to separate the two businesses of tea and aerospace, which have disparate risk-and-reward profiles, to unlock individual value potential. The aerospace segment accounted for over 85% of the consolidated debt during FY23-FY24, given the working capital-intensive nature of the business and the capex undertaken in recent years. While the consolidated net leverage stood at 4.4x in FY24 (FY23: 2.8x), the demerged entity had a net cash position in both years, given the treasury surplus. Adequate Liquidity provides some Cushion against Industry Cyclicality: At end-September 2024, Rossell’s cash and cash equivalents stood at INR380 million (FY24: INR262 million, FY23: INR157 million), indicating the availability of liquidity cushion. Furthermore, the average utilisation of Rossell’s INR670 million fund-based limits was 30%-40% over the 12 months ended November 2024. The company has availed a term loan in FY25 to fund the acquisition of the Dhoedaam tea estate. The new term loan has a moratorium period of one year and staggered repayment starting from March 2026. The tea business is likely to have generated positive cash flow from operations over FY22-FY24, considering the limited working capital requirement at the end of the year, and its cash flow from operations is likely to remain positive over the near-to-medium term. Demerger Reduces Scale to Half; Diversification Benefit Lost: Both tea and aerospace businesses accounted for around half of the company's revenue and EBITDA each during FY22-FY23; in FY24, though, the sharp deterioration in the tea business reduced its contribution. The demerger has resulted in a reduction in Rossell’s scale and made it a single segment company, depriving it of the benefits of diversification, which was evident in FY24, when the consolidated EBITDA was cushioned by the aerospace business. The consolidated revenue pre-demerger came in at INR3,666 million in FY24 (FY23: INR3,536 million), of which INR1,497 million (INR1,672 million) was attributable to the tea business. Of the consolidated EBITDA of INR380 million in FY24 (FY23: INR528 million), the tea division’s contribution declined to INR56 million (around half before allocation of corporate expenses). Net Debt likely to Rise in FY25; Medium-term De-leveraging Contingent on EBITDA Growth:  As per the restated financials of FY24 and 1HFY25, the demerger of the aerospace resulted in Rossell turning net cash positive, given the sizeable treasury surplus and limited debt. The restated gross interest coverage (EBITDA/gross interest expense), however, was lower at 2.2x in FY24 (consolidated: 2.7x), given the fall in EBITDA. Furthermore, on 1 January,2025, Rossell acquired the Dhoedaam tea estate from James Warren Tea Ltd at a total cost of INR642 million, of which INR500 million has already been paid and the balance is payable by the end of January 2025. The amount is subject to net current asset adjustment but is unlikely to increase. A further investment of around INR100 million might be incurred for upgradation and improvisation of the estate and the facilities. The company has tied up a term loan of INR500 million to fund the acquisition, and the balance would be funded by the cash and liquid investments held by the company.  The company’s cash and equivalents stood at INR380 million at end-September 2024. As a result, net debt is likely to increase substantially by the end of FY25, with net leverage likely to be sustain at higher levels than earlier expectations, as the pace of deleveraging would be contingent on sustaining the EBITDA of current operations and ramp-up of the acquired estate. While interest coverage is likely to recover in FY25 due to the rise in EBITDA, it would reduce in FY26 with the additional interest towards the new debt. Seasonality and Cyclicality Inherent in Tea Industry: While the demand for tea is mostly constant throughout the year, the supply varies according to regions and climatic conditions. Production in the south part of the country is almost stable throughout the year. In the northern region, however, the main tea season is June-November, when climatic conditions are ideal, and 75%-80% of the revenue is earned in the second and third quarters of the year (FY24: 74%, FY23: 75%). During May-November, when the rainy season kicks in Assam, the harvesting is done at full pace; the improvement in supply leads to some moderation in margins, but most of the volumes are generated during this period. During December-February, there is no harvesting in Assam, as the plants are pruned during this period. Thus, the bulk of the EBITDA is booked in the second and the third quarters, and the companies incur losses in the fourth quarter, with minimal revenues. Furthermore, being an agro commodity, the production of tea is dependent on factors such as weather conditions and pest infestations, making the business cyclical. Exports play a vital role in maintaining the overall demand-supply balance in the domestic market and are affected by a host of factors, including weather and yields in key exporting nations. Liquidity Adequate: At end-September 2024, Rossell’s cash and cash equivalents stood at INR380 million (FY24: INR262 million, FY23: INR157 million), indicating the availability of liquidity cushion. Furthermore, the average utilisation of fund-based limits was 30%-40% for the 12 months ended November 2024. Post the demerger, Rossell’s fund-based limits have been reduced to INR670 million (from INR2370 million) as most of the limits were towards the aerospace business, given its high working capital requirements. Rossell has availed additional working capital limits of INR100 million post the new acquisition.   The company has a repayment of INR 25million in FY26, which is likely to be funded by internal accruals. The tea business is likely to have generated positive cash flow from operations over FY22-FY24, considering the limited working capital requirement at the end of the year, and the cash flow from operations is likely to remain positive over the near-to-medium term. Rating Sensitivities Positive: Significant and sustained increase in EBITDA along with net leverage of less than 1x on a sustained basis could lead to a positive rating action. Negative:  Fall in EBITDA and/or large capex/acquisitions, resulting in the net leverage exceeding 2x and/or interest coverage remaining below 3x, all on a sustained basis could lead to a negative rating action.

Press Release
Brooks Laboratories Limited
November 07, 2024
Facilities/Instruments Amount (₹ crore) Rating1 Rating Action
7.80
Long Term Bank Facilities CARE BB-; Stable Reaffirmed; Outlook revised from Positive
(Enhanced from 5.80)
4.20
Short Term Bank Facilities CARE A4 Reaffirmed
(Enhanced from 1.00)
Details of instruments/facilities in Annexure-1.
Rationale and key rating drivers
The reaffirmation in ratings and revision in the outlook for the bank facilities of Brooks Laboratories Limited (BLL) takes into
account moderate capital structure owing to high guaranteed debt of associate company, small scale of operations coupled with
losses in Q1FY25 (Unaudited; refers to the period of April 01 to June 30). Further, the ratings assigned continue to remain
constraint by highly regulated and competitive nature of industry.
However, the ratings derive strength from experienced promoters coupled with established track record of operations.
Rating sensitivities: Factors likely to lead to rating actions
Positive factors
• Sustained improvement in scale of operations with total operating income increasing to close to Rs.100 crore and
continued profitable at the PBILDT and cash levels.
• Maintaining the comfortable overall solvency position and efficient working capital management
Negative factors
• Continued losses at the PBILDT and cash level.
• Any major debt funded capex or increase in dependence on working capital borrowings resulting in significant
deterioration of the capital structure
Analytical approach: Standalone
Outlook: Stable
The “Stable” outlook reflects CARE Ratings’ opinion that the company would continue to benefit from its experienced promoters
coupled with established track record of operations and availability of confirmed order book
Detailed description of key rating drivers:
Key weaknesses
Small scale of operations albeit improvement in profitability.
The scale of operations of the company continue to remain small, although improved by 44.53% during FY24 (Audited; refers to
the period April 01 to March 31) to Rs. 80.32 crores as against Rs. 55.57 crores in FY23 (Audited; refers to the period April 01 to
March 31). Further, the scale of operations of the company has remained almost stagnant over the period of 5 years between
FY20 to FY24 and grew at CAGR of just 2.88%.
During FY24, company has booked profit amounting to Rs. 1.53 crores at net level and cash profit of Rs 3.30 crores as compared
to losses amounting to Rs. 8.19 crores at net level and cash loss of Rs 6.47 crores in FY23.These losses during FY23 were primarily
attributed to the higher value of inventory held at the beginning of FY23, as company anticipated a surge in the Covid wave.
However, due to impact of vaccination shots and Covid control measures, company had to sell the material at lower margins. In
terms of operational performance company has booked PBILDT of Rs. 4.05 crores in FY24 as compared to negative PBILDT of
Rs. 5.78 crores during FY23. Further, in Q1FY25 company has booked revenue from operations of Rs. 18.00 crores with PBILDT
of Rs 0.35 crores as against revenue of Rs. 15.70 crores in Q1FY24 with PBILDT of Rs 0.07 crores. Generally, first quarter of the
financial year remains slow as compared to Q2-Q3 and therefore, company expect better performance in current financial year
as well.
Moderate capital structure
The capital structure of the company continued to remain moderate and has deteriorated during FY24, as reflected by adjusted
gearing including guaranteed debt stands at 1.02x as at March 31,2024, as compared to 0.33x as at March 31,2023. This is
1Complete definition of ratings assigned are available at www.careedge.in and other CARE Ratings Limited’s publications.

Press Release
majorly due to fresh bank facilities availed by associate entity BSL leading to guaranteed debt of Rs 65.00 crores as at March
31,2024, as compared to Rs 12.39 crores as at March 31,2023. Although, BLL don’t have any term liabilities apart from lease
liabilities of Rs 0.59 crores as at March 31,2024, and they are availing cash credit limit of Rs. 5.80 crores (Aug 2023 to May 2024)
which was enhanced to Rs. 7.80 crores from June 2024. Wherein, utilisation remained at ~90% during last 12 months ending
September 2024.
Highly regulated and competitive nature of industry
The pharmaceutical industry is a closely monitored and regulated industry and as such there are inherent risks and liabilities
associated with the products and their manufacturing. Regular compliance with product and manufacturing quality standards of
regulatory authorities is critical for selling products across various geographies. BLL is engaged in the manufacturing of
pharmaceutical formulations. The industry is characterized by a high level of competition having presence of a large number of
small and big players.
Key strengths
Experienced management
BLL is currently being managed by all the promoters/directors collectively. Promoter of the company Mr Atul Ranchal & Mr Rajesh
Mahajan have an industry experience of around two decades each; and directors Mr. Jitendra Pratap Singh, Dr. Durga Shankar
Maity, Mr. Bhushan Singh Rana also having experience of around than 2 decades. Furthermore, directors are supported by team
of well-versed professionals having rich experience in their respective fields.
Established track record of operations and reputed clientele
BLL has an industry presence of nearly two decades now, leading to established relationships with the customers as well as
suppliers. The company is engaged in the manufacturing of pharmaceutical formulations and is supplying to various reputed
players. BLL associate entity, Brooks Steriscience Limited (BSL) is a joint venture between BLL and Steriscience Specialties Private
Limited (SSPL) having shareholding of 49% and 51% respectively. Further, BSL plant located in Vadodara has received U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (USFDA) approval for their Vadodara Plant and turnaround of the Vadodara unit and requirement of
funding support from BLL, in the future, will remain a key monitorable.
Liquidity: Stretched
The liquidity position of the company remains stretched as reflected by higher utilisation of working capital limits of around ~90%
during last 12 months ending September 2024, despite of enhancement availed by company of Rs 5.20 crores. Further, in order
to manage losses sustained during FY23 and to manage its working capital requirements, company had raised Rs 11.58 crores
through right issue in June 2023 which was majorly used for repayment to trade payables leading to improvement in current ratio
and quick ratio of 1.32x and 0.90x respectively as on March 31, 2024, as against 0.80x and 0.46x as on March 31,2023. The
company had unencumbered cash & cash equivalent of Rs. 0.05 crore (PY: Rs. 0.02 crore) only as on March 31, 2024. Although,
company currently doesn’t have term liabilities, however, associate company BSL has guaranteed debt of Rs 65 crores (PY: Rs.
12.39 crore) having annual repayment of Rs. 4.67 crores for FY25.

Rating Rationale Rating Rationale June 29, 2024 | Mumbai Alpa Laboratories LimitedIssuer not cooperating, based on best-available information; Ratings continues to be ‘CRISIL B/Stable/CRISIL A4 Issuer not cooperating' Rating ActionTotal Bank Loan Facilities RatedRs.16 CroreLong Term RatingCRISIL B /Stable (ISSUER NOT COOPERATING*)Short Term RatingCRISIL A4 (ISSUER NOT COOPERATING*)Note: None of the Directors on CRISIL Ratings Limited’s Board are members of rating committee and thus do not participate in discussion or assignment of any ratings. The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities*Issuer did not cooperate; based on best-available information Please note that the rating(s) are based on best available information with the credit rating agency: the entity whose debt is being published via this rating rationale did not provide the requisite information needed to conduct the rating exercise or did not provide the No Default Statements (NDS) for the last three months and is therefore classified as 'non cooperative'. Non cooperation by Issuer CRISIL Ratings has been consistently following up with Alpa Laboratories Limited (ALL) for obtaining information through letter and email dated May 15, 2024 among others, apart from telephonic communication. However, the issuer has remained non cooperative. ‘The investors, lenders and all other market participants should exercise due caution with reference to the rating assigned/reviewed with the suffix 'ISSUER NOT COOPERATING' as the rating is arrived at without any management interaction and is based on best available or limited or dated information on the company. Such non co-operation by a rated entity may be a result of deterioration in its credit risk profile. These ratings with 'ISSUER NOT COOPERATING' suffix lack a forward looking component.’ Detailed Rationale Despite repeated attempts to engage with the management, CRISIL Ratings failed to receive any information on either the financial performance or strategic intent of ALL, which restricts CRISIL Ratings’ ability to take a forward looking view on the entity's credit quality. CRISIL Ratings believes that rating action on ALL is consistent with ‘Assessing Information Adequacy Risk’. Based on the last available information, the ratings on bank facilities of ALL continues to be ‘CRISIL B/Stable/CRISIL A4 Issuer Not Cooperating’.

*Instrument details are provided in Annexure-I
Rationale
The revision in outlook on the long-term rating to Stable from Positive factors in the subdued performance of Repro India
Limited’s (Repro) traditional offset printing segment in H1 FY2025, which is likely to moderate the revenue growth and
operating profitability for full year FY2025. While the revenues in digital printing segment grew by 18% YoY in H1 FY2025, the
company’s consolidated revenues declined by 8% YoY to Rs. 217.0 crore on account of lower sales in the traditional offset
printing segment by 43% YoY due to delay in finalisation of syllabus by NCERT in K-12 segment. With finalisation of syllabus by
NCERT for the affected grades within the K-12 segment, the order flow and thus, the revenues from the traditional offset
business are expected to recover in H2 FY2025. ICRA expects the revenue to grow by a modest 2-3% in FY2025 (against the
earlier expectations of 10-12%). Given the significant decline in traditional offset printing revenues, the company’s overall
operating profit margins (OPM) contracted by 430 bps to 6.0% in H1 FY2025 and are projected to be in the range of 8-8.5% in
FY2025 (PY: 10.9%).
The rating reaffirmation factors in the comfortable leverage and adequate debt coverage indicators estimated for FY2025,
despite a modest performance in H1 FY2025. For FY2025, ICRA estimates the leverage measured by Total Debt/OPBDITA to
remain comfortable at ~1.7 times (FY2024: 0.9 times), while the debt coverage indicators are estimated to remain adequate
with interest coverage of ~4.8 times (FY2024: 5.4 times) and DSCR of 2.5 times (FY2024: 1.5 times). The ratings note the
extensive experience of Repro’s promoters spanning more than two decades in the printing industry and the strong client base
comprising leading publishers.
The ratings, however, remain constrained by the vulnerability of profitability to adverse fluctuations in raw material prices and
high working capital intensity of operations in the traditional offset printing business due to high receivables and inventory.
However, with increase in the share of digital business, which has lower inventory requirement and faster collections, the
working capital intensity, on an overall basis, is expected to remain moderate. ICRA notes the intense competition from the
unorganised players in the traditional offset printing business, which limits its pricing flexibility and bargaining power with
customers. In the e-tailing segment, it faces competition from other distributors who tie-up with the publishers. The ratings
consider the modest return indicators (RoCE) owing to high capital intensity and volatile operating profitability in the past.
Going forward, given the healthy ramp-up in operations, the company's ability to manage its working capital cycle judiciously,
while keeping its receivables and inventory levels under control, and improve its profitability will remain the key monitorable.

The Stable outlook on the long-term rating reflects ICRA’s expectations that the company would be able to witness a recovery
in the traditional offset printing segment in the near to medium term, while sustaining its healthy performance in the digital
printing segment. Further, ICRA’s outlook underpins the sustenance of the comfortable leverage and adequate debt coverage
indicators.
Key rating drivers and their description
Credit strengths
Comfortable leverage and adequate debt coverage indicators – As of March 2024, the company’s total debt reduced to Rs.
48.8 crore from Rs. 96.2 crore as of March 2023, on account of prepayments done using the Rs. 77.8 crore of preference share
capital raised in September 2023, resulting in a healthy improvement in its leverage and coverage indicators. As of September
2024, the total debt stood at Rs. 60.0 crore and comprised lease liabilities of Rs. 25.5 crore, term loans of Rs. 0.22 crore and
working capital borrowings of Rs. 34.3 crore. While the company’s modest performance in H1 FY2025 impacted its leverage
and coverage metrics to some extent, the same are expected to improve on account of better performance in H2 FY2025. For
FY2025, ICRA estimates the leverage measured by Total Debt/OPBDITA to remain comfortable at ~1.7 times (FY2024: 0.9
times), while the debt coverage indicators are estimated to remain adequate with interest coverage of ~4.8 times (FY2024: 5.4
times) and DSCR of 2.5 times (FY2024: 1.5times).
Extensive experience of promoters in printing business; healthy client profile with established relationships – The promoters
have more than two decades of experience in the printing industry. The company has healthy long-term relationships with
reputed clients. Its export clients are leading global publishers like Cambridge University Press, Oxford University Press, Taylor
and Francis, among others. In the domestic market, the Group works for large education publishers including Macmillan
Publishers, Oswal Books Learning Ltd, SVKM NMIMS, Wiley India, Symbiosis (Distance Learning), Arihant Publication, Penguin
Publishing India Pvt Ltd, etc. Further, under its digital printing business, the Group has forged relationships with key e-
commerce players such as Amazon, Flipkart, JIO, Meesho, First Cry and Snapdeal. Repro’s key exports markets include Kenya,
Sierra Leone, Nigeria, South Africa, the UK, and the USA.
Continued healthy growth in digital printing segment – The company’s digital printing segment reported robust growth (YoY
growth of 20% in FY2024), with 18% YoY increase in revenues to Rs. 84 crore in Q2 FY2025 and 18% YoY in H1 FY2025 to Rs.
162 crore, driven by a rise in the number of publishers (YoY growth of 10%) and growth in direct contents in repository to 9.5
lakh titles (YoY growth of 22%). The growth momentum in digital segment is expected to continue with the initiatives taken
in technology investments and diversified product offering to publishers ranging from print on demand, micro-POD facilities,
warehouse integration, import substitution offerings for specialised international publishers, integrated print solutions and
multiple domestic and international e-distribution channels (Amazon, Flipkart, Bookscape, Amazon US, Walmart US and
Canada, etc).
Credit challenges
Subdued H1 FY2025 performance and modest return indicators; stiff competition – The company’s consolidated revenues
declined by 8% YoY in H1 FY2025 to Rs. 217 .0 crore on account of lower sales in the traditional offset printing segment by 43%
YoY due to delay in finalisation of syllabus by NCERT in the K-12 segment. With finalisation of syllabus by NCERT for the affected
grades within the K-12 segment, the order flow and thus, the revenues from the traditional offset business are expected to
recover in H2 FY2025. ICRA expects the revenue to grow by a modest 2-3% in FY2025 (against earlier expectations of 10-12%).
Given the significant decline in traditional offset printing revenues in H1 FY2025, the company’s overall OPM contracted by
430 bps to 6.0% in H1 FY2025 and are projected to be in the range of 8-8.5% in FY2025 (PY: 10.9%). Its RoCE has historically
remained modest owing to high capital intensity and volatile operating profitability. The RoCE was at 6.3% in FY2024 and is
expected to remain at around 3% in FY2025 and witness a steady improvement going forward, with the increase in revenues
and profitability. Repro faces stiff competition from unorganised players in the traditional offset printing business, which limits
www.icra .in 2

its pricing flexibility and bargaining power with customers. Further, in the e-tailing segment, it faces competition from other
distributors who tie-up with the publishers.
Vulnerability of profitability to adverse fluctuations in raw material prices – The key raw materials required by the company
are printing paper and ink. Its operating profitability remains vulnerable to fluctuations in the prices of these key inputs. The
contracts entered by Repro incorporate an escalation clause, which allows the company to renegotiate the cost in case of more
than 5% variation in the price of the key raw materials. This shields its profitability margins from adverse fluctuations in the
prices of raw materials to an extent.
Working capital-intensive nature of traditional offset printing business – The company’s working capital intensity (NWC/OI)
is high for the offset printing business due to the elongated receivables and inventory levels. On an overall basis, the NWC/OI
remained moderate at 23% in FY2024 and 24% in H1 FY2025, improving from ~37% in FY2021, with an increase in the share of
digital printing business, which has a lean working capital cycle, and is expected to remain ~25% for FY2025 and FY2026.
Environmental and social risks
Environmental and social considerations – Repro’s operations are linked to the paper industry. Hence, it is exposed to risks
arising from the tightening regulations on the environment and the safety front. Heightened environmental concerns may
increase its raw material costs or moderate demand for printed materials in certain segments. As per the disclosures made by
Repro, it aims at reducing the carbon footprint of multinational publishers via import substitution. It operates green
manufacturing facilities and engages in responsible raw material procurement. While Repro remains exposed to the
environment and social risk, it does not materially affect its credit profile as of now.
Liquidity position: Adequate
As on September 30, 2024, Repro had free cash and cash equivalents of around Rs. 1.8 crore and average cushion of Rs. 49.7
crore of undrawn working capital limits (based on the drawing power) during April to September 2024 period. The liquidity
buffers are likely to be adequate for meeting the increasing working capital requirements as operations ramp up. The
scheduled debt repayments are expected to be comfortably met from its cash flow from operations.
Rating sensitivities
Positive factors – Sustained growth in revenues and profitability resulting in an improvement in debt protection metrics and
liquidity could lead to a rating upgrade.
Negative factors – Significant decline in revenues or profitability and/or considerable increase in indebtedness leading to
deterioration of debt protection metrics could lead to a rating downgrade. Specific credit metrics for a rating downgrade will
be Total Debt/OPBDITA of more than 2.25 times on a sustained basis.

Details of instruments/facilities in Annexure-1.
Rationale and key rating drivers
The ratings assigned to bank facilities and fixed deposit instrument of Kuantum Papers Limited (KPL) have been reaffirmed and
removed from rating watch with developing implications while assigning a stable outlook to its long-term facilities. Ratings were
earlier placed on ‘rating watch with developing implications’ for large size capex with an impending financial closure, which has
been achieved now following entire debt tie-up with the same envisaged mix of debt and internal accruals of 73:27. The capex
entails upgrading existing plant and machineries and debottlenecking of capacities at a total cost of ₹735 crore, which is expected
to be funded by term loan of ₹535 crore and remaining from internal accruals.
The ratings continue to derive comfort from strong operational and financial performance in FY24 (refers to April 01 to March 31)
marked by healthy cash accruals during the year despite slight moderation in scale of operations due to reduction in net sales
realisations (NSR) across the paper industry. However, operating profit margins remained stable owing to the company’s
continuous focus on process and cost optimisation measures post implementing backward integration project in March 2021. In
Q1FY25 (refers to April 01 to June 30), despite moderation in scale of operations, the company was able to maintain healthy
operating margins due to benefits of backward integration project. Ratings continue to derive strength from experienced
management team and resourceful promoters, established supplier and distribution network, diversified product profile and
proximity of manufacturing plant to raw material sources. However, ratings continue to remain constrained due to intense
competition in the writing and printing paper industry and profitability margins vulnerable to volatile raw material prices, and
project implementation and stabilisation risk.
Rating sensitivities: Factors likely to lead to rating actions
Positive factors
• Improvement in scale of operations to more than ₹2000 crore and profit before interest, lease rentals, depreciation, and
taxation (PBILDT) margin of over 25% on sustained basis.
• Significant reduction total debt (TD) to PBILDT to less than 1x, improvement in capital structure and healthy liquidity
position.
• Successful implementation and stabilisation of the planned project, without time and cost overruns.
Negative factors
• Deterioration in operational performance, impacting debt coverage indicators such as interest coverage ratio falling
below 8.5x and total debt to gross cash accruals (TD/GCA) increasing beyond 2.5x.
• Decline in scale of operations with moderation in PBILDT margin below 20%.
Analytical approach: Standalone approach
Outlook: Stable
CARE Ratings Limited (CARE Ratings) expects company to have stable operational performance. CARE Ratings also believes that
KPL shall sustain its comfortable financial risk profile in the medium term.

Press Release
Detailed description of key rating drivers:
Key strengths
Stable Operational performance
Despite overall downturn across paper industry, the company reported total operating income of ₹1,211.30 crore in FY24, against
₹1,309.56 crore in FY23, reporting y-o-y moderation of ~8%. The company’s PBILDT margin remained almost stable at 28.08%
in FY24 (PY: 29%) and the profit after taxes (PAT) margin stood at 15.18% in FY24 (PY: 10.40%) supported by higher repayment
of term loans against its term loan obligations.
In Q1FY25 (refers to April 01 to June 30), the company’s total operating income (TOI) moderated by ~10% and stood at ₹281.61
crore in Q1FY25 (Q1FY24: ₹313.65 crore). Moderation in performance was largely due to subdued demand for writing and
printing paper (WPP) due to deferment of Government tenders, seasonal closing of educational institutions and courts for summer
vacations, and input cost pressures arising from higher imported pulp cost due to higher ocean freight. This impacted net sales
realisations of paper companies across industry. Despite these market challenges on pricing, the company was able to maintain
a healthy PBILDT margin of 25.72% (Q1FY24: 35.17%), which has been due to the company’s continuous focus on process and
cost optimisation measures post implementation of backward integration project, which achieved commercial operation date
(COD) in March 2021.
Comfortable financial risk profile
The company’s capital structure remained comfortable and improved with overall gearing ratio of 0.72x as on March 31, 2024
(PY: 0.83x). Improvement was owing to accretion of profits to net worth and repayment of term loans aggregating to ₹80.44
crore (including prepayment), which was backed by improved operational performance leading to healthy cash flow generation.
Debt coverage indicators also stood comfortable with interest coverage ratio improving to 8.07x as on March 31, 2024 (PY: 5.31x)
and TD/GCA remaining almost stable at 2.13x as on March 31, 2024 (PY: 2.06x).
Long track record of operations with an experienced management team & resourceful promoter
KPL is engaged in manufacturing paper for over four decades, which helped establish long-standing business relationships with
customers and getting regular orders from them. Jagesh Khaitan, Chairman, has an overall experience of around five decades
and is associated with the company since its inception. The company’s day-to-day affairs are managed by Pavan Khaitan, son of
Jagesh Khaitan, who is assisted by a team of highly experienced professionals in their respective domains. Promoters have
extended continuous financial support over the years to fund the company’s business requirements. There has been a track record
of financial support by promoters in the form of unsecured loans.
Diversified product profile alongside established distribution network
KPL manufactures a wide range of WPP including maplitho, cream wove, copier paper and value-added specialty products such
as azure laid papers, parchment paper, cartridge paper, ledger paper, stiffener paper, coloured paper, and base paper for specialty
paper products including paper cups, paper straws, and thermal rolls among others, in 42 – 200 GSM range. Paper manufactured
by the company find its application in printing books, note books, calendars, diaries, newspaper supplements, pamphlets, and
computer stationary, among others. The company has recently introduced new product ‘Kuantum Korra’, which is specifically
designed for the notebook segment. The diverse product mix provides comfort to KPL’s revenue stream. KPL has pan-India
network of over 90 dealers, across Delhi, Haryana, UP, MP, Punjab, West Bengal and Maharashtra; it also exports paper to
overseas markets. Over the years, KPL has established a strong customer-base and gets repeat orders from most clients.
Location advantage leading to easy availability of raw material
KPL utilises agricultural residues such as wheat straw, kana grass and bagasse, while wood comprising wood chips, wood logs
and bamboo are main raw materials. The plant is in the agriculture belt of Punjab, because of which, availability of such raw
materials is in abundance. Since KPL has an established business relation with dealers engaged in selling wheat straw (long-
standing of about four decades in the industry), it experiences no major issues in procurement. In the past, the company also
widened supply chain partners to ensure regular availability of raw materials, spares and other inputs for an uninterrupted
production.
Key weaknesses
Project implementation and stabilisation risk
The company is undertaking an expansion project of ₹735 crore, spread over FY24 – FY26, which is for upgrading existing plant
and machineries and debottlenecking capacities. This is post the surge in demand for paper with strong tailwinds in the form of
National Education Policy (NEP) and single use plastic ban for Writing & Printing Paper Industry. The company is planning to
enhance its existing capacity of paper machines from 450 TPD to 675 TPD, agro-pulp capacity from 165 TPD to 198 TPD and
wood pulp capacity from 200 TPD to 240 TPD. It also plans to upgrade its turbine from 38 MW to 41.5 MW, installation of new
centrifugal compressors for power cost reduction, enhanced product basket with 50 TPD speciality grade coated paper, and
improvement of plantation infrastructure among others. The project is to be funded by term loan of ₹535 crore and remaining
from internal accruals, where the entire term loan has been duly sanctioned by banks. Of the total project cost, ~23% has already
been incurred; funded through debt of ₹77 crore and remaining from internal accruals up to August 31, 2024. The project is
expected to achieve COD by March 2026, which is expected to enhance overall capacities from 1,48,500 MTPA in FY24 to 2,50,000
MTPA by FY26.

Press Release
Highly competitive industry and margins susceptible to volatile raw material prices
The paper industry is highly fragmented with stiff competition from a large number of organised and unorganised players. This
limits pricing power of manufacturers and puts further pressure on profitability. The industry is impacted by economic cycles. KPL
majorly uses agro based raw material, which is purchased from domestic markets. With respect to agro-based raw materials,
there are limitations due to seasonal availability, leading to high volatility in their prices. Therefore, the company’s operating
profitability remains highly susceptible to raw material price volatility. However, the company has insulated itself by undertaking
backward integration and enhancing capacities of pulp, paper and co-generation power plant and by setting up a chemical
recovery plant.
Industry Prospects
There was a downtrend observed in the paper industry in FY24 on the back of fall in the realisations despite higher input costs
due to increased competition from imports. There was a sharp drop in prices of packaging board, maplitho paper and coated
paper, with a slight drop in copier paper prices. There was also some commodity price correction also including pulp and coal,
which gave some benefit. However, wood cost, which is a basic raw material for integrated pulp manufacturer, remained high
and went up sharply by close to ~30-35%, impacting profitability. However, rebound is expected FY25 onwards as the adoption
of the New Education policy is likely to boost demand for WPP segment and increasing penetration of specialised and conventional
packaging in sectors such as FMCG, healthcare, e-commerce, and pharmaceuticals, among others. Other key demand factors will
include a focus on innovative and attractive packaging and the shift from plastic to paper-based packaging in FMCG and food &
food product sectors.
Liquidity: Adequate
Adequate liquidity characterised by sufficient cushion in expected accruals of ₹290.03 crore against repayment obligations of
₹113.59 crore in FY25 and modest cash balance of ₹70.59 crore as on March 31, 2024. The company has liquidity cushion with
sufficient drawing power available against sanctioned limits. Limit utilisation stood at ~57% for 12-months ending
September,2024.
Environment, social, and governance (ESG) risks
Primary ESG factors affecting the paper industry are pollution control norms. Governance remains a universal concept affecting
all sectors and geographies. Majority paper companies seems to be focusing on pollution control norms, as paper industry is one
of the most pollution emission industries, as identified and categorised by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). To reduce
emission, companies in this sector install chemical recovery plants, and effluent treatment plants, among others.

The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities Detailed Rationale Crisil Ratings has reaffirmed its ratings on the bank facilities of Valiant Organics Limited (VOL) at ‘Crisil A-/Negative/Crisil A2+’. The ratings continue to reflect VOL's established market position backed by extensive experience of promoters and healthy capital structure. These rating strengths are partially offset by VOL's large working capital requirement and exposure to risks inherent in the end user industry. Analytical Approach Crisil Ratings has evaluated the standalone business and financial risk profiles of VOL. Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description Strengths: Established market position backed by extensive experience of promoters: VOL's promoters have been engaged in the chemical intermediates business for over three decades which has enabled them to develop a strong understanding of market dynamics and establish healthy relations with customers and suppliers. VOL has a diversified business profile with diversity at product, customer and end-use industry level. The established market position is also reflected in a healthy operating income of Rs 514.95 crore in 9MFY25. Healthy capital structure: The financial risk profile metrics continue to remain strong, with a robust net worth to be around Rs 653.67 crore as on Sept 30th, 2024. This supports the financial flexibility of the company. Supported by a robust net worth and low dependence on external debt, the capital structure is comfortable with gearing around 0.27 time as on Sept 30th, 2024. This is expected to remain comfortable going forward. VOL does not have major debt funded capex plans over medium term. Weaknesses: Large working capital requirement: Operations are likely to remain working capital intensive over the medium term. Gross current assets were moderately high at 162 days as on Sept 30th, 2024, driven by inventory and debtors of 60 days and 82 days, respectively. A credit of 150-160 days are provided to customers with good track record and inventory of around 60-70 days is maintained owing to the large product portfolio. This working capital requirement is funded by extended creditors and working capital limits from the bank. Operations are expected to remain working capital intensive over the medium term. Exposure to risks inherent in the end user industry : VOL derives revenue from four major segments which are Hydrogenation , Chlorination , Ammonolysis and others which are part of different end user industries like Dyes &Pigments , Pharmaceuticals , Specialty Chemicals and Agro chemicals .Further performance of the VOL closely linked with performance of key user industries .Any slow down in key user industries would affect performance of VOL negatively as seen from the moderation in the operating margin during fiscal 2024 and H1FY25. Accordingly, debt protection metrics are moderate, with interest cover and net cash accruals to adjusted debt ratios (NCAAD) around 1.56 times and 0.04 times, respectively during H1FY25. Liquidity: Adequate Bank limit utilization is low at around 36.07 percent for the past twelve eight ending December 2024.  Cash accruals are expected to be over Rs 50 Crores which is sufficient against term debt obligation of Rs 35-40 Crores over the medium term. In addition, it will act as a cushion to the liquidity of the company. The current ratio is moderate at 0.25 times as on Sept 30th, 2024. Moderate cash and bank balance of around Rs. 9 Crores as on Sept 30th, 2024. Low gearing and moderate net worth support its financial flexibility and provides the financial cushion available in case of any adverse conditions or downturn in the business. Outlook: Negative Scale of operations and profitability may remain constrained amid tepid demand which may impact business risk profile over the medium term Rating sensitivity factors Upward factors Sustained revenue growth supported by growth in volume sales on the back of increased offtake and operating margin above 14% resulting in higher net cash accruals Sustenance of financial risk profile and working capital management. Downward factors Decline in scale of operations with operating margin remaining below 8%, hence leading to net cash accruals below Rs.60 Crores. Stretch in its working capital requirements thus weakening its liquidity & financial profile About the Company Established in 1984 as Valiant Chemical Corporation and then later changed to Valiant Organics Limited (VOL) in 2005, the company is engaged in the business of manufacturing specialty chemicals. The company is promoted by Gogri,Chedda and Gala families and is based out of Mumbai, Maharashtra. The company acquired Abhilasha Tex Chem Pvt.

Rating Rationale × Info! Info Alert × Success! Success Alert × Warning! Warning Alert × Error! Error Alert RATING RATIONALE 11Apr2025 United Polyfab Gujarat Ltd. Brickwork Ratings reaffirms the long-term and short-term ratings for the Bank Loan Facilities of Rs. 126.29 Crs. of United Polyfab Gujarat Ltd. based on best available information, as the issuer did not cooperate. Particulars Facilities** Amount (Rs.Crs.) Tenure Rating# Previous Present Previous(20 Mar 2024) Present Fund Based 124.79 124.79 Long Term BWR B+ /Stable Continues to be in ISSUER NOT COOPERATING* category/Downgraded BWR B + /Stable Continues to be in ISSUER NOT COOPERATING* category/Reaffirmed Non Fund Based 1.50 1.50 Short Term BWR A4 Continues to be in ISSUER NOT COOPERATING* category/Reaffirmed BWR A4 Continues to be in ISSUER NOT COOPERATING* category/Reaffirmed Grand Total 126.29 126.29 (Rupees One Hundred Twenty Six Crores and Twenty Nine lakhs Only) #Please refer to BWR website www.brickworkratings.com for definition of the ratings **Details of Bank Loan facilities,consolidation or instruments are provided in Annexure *Issuer did not cooperate; based on best available information. RATING ACTION / OUTLOOK / NATURE OF NON-COOPERATION Brickwork Ratings (BWR) has last rated the bank loan facilities of “United Polyfab Gujarat Ltd” in Mar2024 by downgrading the long-term rating to "BWR B+/Stable" from "BWR BB-/Stable" and reaffirmed the short-term rating at "BWR A4" with continuation of ratings under the ISSUER NOT COOPERATING* category. BWR has consistently taken up with the company through emails and telephone calls to provide the requisite information for the review of the ratings. Despite the best efforts of BWR to get at least the minimum required information for a review, the company has not been submitting the monthly “No Default Statement” (NDS) as required by regulatory guidelines and remains to be non-cooperative. Due to the lack of management cooperation, BWR is unable to assess the company’s ability to service its debt and maintain a valid rating. Hence, owing to lack of management cooperation, Brickwork Ratings reaffirms the long-term and short-term ratings at "BWR B+/Stable/BWR A4" and continues the ratings under the ISSUER NOT COOPERATING* category, based on best available information. The lenders/investors may note to exercise due caution while using the rating which mentions "Issuer Not Cooperating" since the rating lacks any projections or forward-looking component as it is arrived at based on the best available information without any management/banker's interaction. LIMITATIONS OF THE RATING Information availability risk is a key factor in the assessment of credit risk as generally, non-cooperation by the rated entities to provide required information for a review of the assigned rating may also be accompanied by financial stress. Users of the credit rating should therefore take into account possible deterioration in the credit quality of the rated entity arising from its non-transparency withholding of information required for a review of the rating ABOUT THE ENTITY Macro Economic Indicator Sector Industry Basic Industry Consumer Discretionary Textiles Textiles & Apparels Other Textile Products United Polyfab Gujarat Limited was incorporated as United Polyfab (Unit-II) Private Limited under the provision of the Companies Act, 1956 vide certificate of incorporation dated November 16, 2010, issued by the Registrar of Companies, Ahmedabad.

Rating Rationale Rating Rationale April 24, 2025 | Mumbai Shree Digvijay Cement Co. Limited 'Crisil A/Negative' assigned to Corporate Credit Rating; Rated amount enhanced for Bank Debt Rating ActionTotal Bank Loan Facilities RatedRs.300 Crore (Enhanced from Rs.100 Crore)Long Term RatingCrisil A/Negative (Reaffirmed)Short Term RatingCrisil A1 (Reaffirmed)  Corporate Credit RatingCrisil A/Negative (Assigned)Note: None of the Directors on Crisil Ratings Limited’s Board are members of rating committee and thus do not participate in discussion or assignment of any ratings. The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities Detailed Rationale Crisil Rating has assigned its ‘Crisil A/Negative’ corporate credit rating to Shree Digvijay Cement Co. Limited (SDCCL). Crisil Ratings has also reaffirmed its ratings on the bank loan facilities of SDCCL at ‘Crisil A/Negative/Crisil A1’. The rating continues to reflect SDCCL’s established market position in the cement industry, comfortable operating efficiencies, and healthy financial risk profile even though debt-funded capex is planned. These strengths are partially offset by large working capital requirement, exposure to intense competition and risks related to volatility in raw material prices, susceptibility to risks related to the commoditized nature of products and cyclicality in the cement industry. Analytical Approach For arriving at the ratings, Crisil Ratings has taken a consolidated approach for SDCCL and its wholly owned subsidiary, SDCCL Logistics Ltd. Please refer Annexure - List of Entities Consolidated, which captures the list of entities considered and their analytical treatment of consolidation. Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description Strengths: Established market position in western India and improved scale of operations: The company is an established player in the cement industry with a long track record of more than five decades and installed capacity of 1.5 MTPA. It manufactures cement of various kinds, including Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), Portland Pozzolana Cement (PPC), Sulphate Resisting Portland Cement (SRPC), Oil Well Cement (OWC) and other special cements. The products are marketed under the brand, Kamal. On the group level, revenue grew 9% on-year to Rs 790 crore in fiscal 2024 backed by marginal increase in volume and improved average sales realisation. The demand scenario remained weak in the first 9 months of fiscal 2025 and the average realisation and operating margin remain subdued. The group estimates revenue of Rs ~509 crore and operating margin of 5.80% during this time. Though timely improvement in realization in cement prices will help to improve performance in the coming quarters, any prolonged cost pressures resulting in subdued operating margin may weaken credit profile. There is abundant availability of limestone in its captive mines along with waste heat recovery (WHR) system of 4.5 MW, which is adequate to meet 25-30% of its requirement. The company also has hybrid power contract for capacity of 8.10 MW hybrid wind and solar power with Continuum Energy. Hence, the WHR system along with hybrid power contracts would constitute over 65% of the power needs of the company. Healthy financial risk profile, despite debt-funded capex: Networth improved to Rs 365.75 crore as on March 31, 2024, from Rs 309.35 crore in the previous fiscal on the back of steady accretion to reserves. The TOLANW ratio was low at 0.42 time on account of payables. Strong profitability led to robust debt protection metrics, with interest coverage ratio of 73.65 times for fiscal 2024. SDCCL announced brownfield capex for setting up 3.0 million tonne cement grinding capacity (from existing capacity of 1.5 million tonne). The overall project cost is estimated at Rs 250 crore and is to be funded through debt of 50% and balance through internal accrual. The capacity is expected to be commissioned in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. Given the size of the project, the company is exposed to execution risks and its ability to ramp up expanded capacity. Hence, timely commencement of commercial operations, within budgeted cost, will remain a key monitorable. However, SDCCL’s past track record of successfully completing various capacity addition projects provides comfort. Although 50% of the capex will be debt-funded, the capital structure is expected to remain comfortable due to healthy accrual and scheduled debt repayment. Weaknesses: Modest working capital requirement: Gross current assets were 125 days as on March 31, 2024 (129 days as on March 31, 2023), due to sizeable inventory of 75 days and receivables of 15 days, (67 days and 11 days, respectively). The working capital cycle was partly supported by payables, which are likely to remain at a similar level over the medium term. Any improvement in the working capital cycle will remain monitorable. Exposure to intense competition, risks related to volatility in raw material prices, the commoditised nature of products and cyclicality in the cement industry: Cement players, including SDCCL, are susceptible to fluctuations in the prices of coal/petcoke, various raw materials (other than limestone which is captively available), packing materials and diesel. Against this, exposure to intense competition and limited product differentiation limits the pricing flexibility of players. Capacity additions in the commoditised cement industry tend to be sporadic because of long gestation periods associated with setting up of new facilities and numerous players adding capacities during the peak of a cycle. This led to unfavourable price cycles for the sector in the past. Cyclical downturns in the industry result in slow offtake, constraining the operating rate and the ability of players to pass on any rise in input costs. Liquidity: Strong Bank limit utilisation is low at around 19.66 percent for the past twelve months ended November 2024. Cash accrual are expected to be over Rs 54 crore  against no term debt obligation. In addition, it will be act as cushion to the liquidity of the company. Current ratio is healthy at 1.99 times on March 31, 2024. Outlook: Negative Operating performance may remain subdued owing to realization and any delay in the commencement of ongoing capex or price escalation can weaken the credit profile of the company. Rating sensitivity factors Upward factors: Considerable revenue growth and operating margin at 18-20% leading to higher accrual. Sustained financial risk profile. Downward factors: Prolong subdue realization or demand, which led to reduction in the operating profit below 10% in coming quarters. Sizeable stretch in the working capital cycle or large, debt-funded capex weakening the financial risk profile, especially liquidity. About the Company Incorporated in November 1944, SDCCL manufactures cement at the coastal township of Digvijaygram (Sikka) in Jamnagar district of Gujarat. The company has an installed capacity of 1.5 MTPA. The company is listed on the NSE and BSE.

Rating Rationale
Acuité has downgraded the long-term rating to 'ACUITE BBB-' (read as ACUITE triple B minusf)rom
'ACUITE BBB' (read as ACUITE triple Ba)nd the short-term rating to 'ACUITE A3' (read as ACUITE A
three) from 'ACUITE A3+' (read as ACUITE A three plus)on the Rs.65.94 Cr. bank facilities of Aarey Drugs
and Pharmaceuticals Limited (ADPL). The outlook is revised from 'Negative' to 'Stable'.
Acuite has withdrawn the long-term rating on Rs.5.06 Cr. and short-term rating on Rs.8.55 Cr. bank facility without
assigning any rating as it is a proposed facility of Aarey Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited. The rating has been
withdrawn on account of the request received from the company. The rating withdrawal is in accordance with
Acuité's policy on withdrawal of rating as applicable to the respective facility / instrument.
Rationale for Rating
The rating downgrade of ADPL considers decline in revenues and profitability in FY2024 which further moderated
in 9MFY2025 along with elongation in working capital cycle of the company. However, the rating is supported
with experienced management of the company with an established track record of operations and healthy financial
risk profile. Further, the rating remains constrained on account of foreign exchange risk and company’s presence
in highly competitive industry.
About the Company
ADPL incorporated in 1990, is a Mumbai based company engaged in the business of manufacturing of Active
Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), intermediates, specialty chemicals and offers a range of products for diverse
industrial applications. The company caters to pharmaceuticals formulation manufacturers and pharmaceutical

Rs.24.43 crore which is going to be undertaken in 2 phases i.e., 13000MT of each out of which Phase 1 is
expected to be operational is November 2025 and Phase 2 in August 2026.
Acuité believes that the financial risk profile of ADPL is expected to be moderate over the medium term due to an
increase expected in the debt levels towards completion of the proposed capex.
Weaknesses
Declining operating performance
The operating performance of ADPL remained subdued with decline in operating income of Rs.397.65 Cr. in
FY2024 as against Rs.418.96 Cr. in FY2023. In addition to this, the operating margins of the company declined
and stood at 1.64 percent against 1.84 per cent albeit the PAT margins improved marginally and stood at 1.18 per
cent in FY2024 as against 0.90 per cent in FY2023. For the current financial year, as of the 9MFY2025, ADPL has
shown improvement in revenues, reaching Rs.365.84 crore compared to Rs.185.26 crore for the same period last
year. The company expects to close the year with revenue of ~Rs. 470.00 crore. However, the operating
profitability recorded a decline and stood at 1.94 percent in 9MFY2025 as against 3.18 percent for the same
period last year.
Acuité believes that the ability of ADPL to improve its scale of operations while improving the profitability
margins will remain a key rating sensitivity factor.
Working capital intensive operations
The working capital operations of ADPL are moderately intensive marked by its high Gross Current Assets (GCA)
days of 258 days for FY2024 which stood high against 235 days for FY2023. This is on account of its receivables
cycle which though remains elongated and stood at 170 days in FY2024 as against 167 days in FY2023. On the
other hand, the creditors also stood high at 123 days in FY2024 as against 115 days in FY2023. In general, the
company offers credit period of upto 120 days to its customers and it Back to top 13 enjoys credit period of upto
60 days in normal course of business from its suppliers. The inventory days of the company stood at 32 days in
FY2024 as against 26 days in FY2023. The average bank limit utilization for 6 months’ period ended December
2024 stood high at ~95 percent.
Acuité believes that the ability of ADPL to improve and maintain an efficient working capital cycle over the
medium term will remain a key rating sensitivity factor.
Foreign exchange and commodity price risk
ADPL imports traded products from overseas suppliers. The profitability of the company is also exposed to
fluctuation in the product prices as the same constitutes a significant portion of the total sales. The prices of the
commodity fluctuate and are highly dependent on the demand and supply scenario in the global market. Hence, the
margins of the ADPL are exposed to volatility in the foreign exchange rate.
Acuité Ratings & Research Limited www.acuite.in
Competitive and fragmented industry
The pharmaceutical formulations and chemical compounds industry has a large number of players which makes this
industry highly fragmented and intensely competitive. ADPL is also a moderate sized player, thereby limiting its
bargaining power and susceptibility to pricing pressure is also higher compared to well-established and larger
players. However, the company's presence of over three decades in the industry has enabled it to partially offset
competitive pressures. Further, it undertakes regular research and development to improve its product offerings.
This will help the company in improving its competitive position.
Rating Sensitivities
Ability to improve scale of operations while improving the profitability margins
Ability to improve and maintain an efficient working capital cycle
Deterioration in financial risk profile owing to higher-than-expected debt funded capex
Liquidity Position
Adequate
ADPL has adequate liquidity position marked by sufficient net cash accruals (NCA) to its no maturing debt
obligations. The company generated cash accruals of Rs.6.38 Cr. in FY2024 against no maturing debt obligations.
The company is further expected to generate cash accruals in the range of Rs.7.00-10.00 Cr. during FY2025 to
FY2027 against repayment obligation in the range of Rs.1.00-1.50 crore during the same period. The working
capital operations of the company are moderately intensive marked by its gross current asset (GCA) days of 258
days for FY2024 as against 235 days for FY2023 on account of its elongated receivables cycle. The average bank
limit utilization for 6 months’ period ended December 2024 stood high at ~95 percent. Current ratio stands at 1.70
times as on 31 March 2024. The company has maintained cash & bank balance of Rs.1.59 Cr. in FY2024.

Note on complexity levels of the rated instrument
In order to inform the investors about complexity of instruments, Acuité has categorized such instruments in three
levels: Simple, Complex and Highly Complex. Acuite’s categorisation of the instruments across the three
categories is based on factors like variability of the returns to the investors, uncertainty in cash flow patterns,
number of counterparties and general understanding of the instrument by the market. It has to be understood that
complexity is different from credit risk and even an instrument categorized as 'Simple' can carry high levels of
risk. For more details, please refer Rating Criteria “Complexity Level Of Financial Instruments” on www.acuite.in.

Rating Rationale Rating Rationale April 11, 2025 | Mumbai Capital Infra Trust 'Crisil AAA/Stable' Converted from Provisional Rating to Final Rating Rating Action Rs.1200 Crore Non Convertible Debentures Crisil AAA/Stable (Converted from Provisional Rating to Final Rating) Rs.1200 Crore Non Convertible Debentures Crisil AAA/Stable (Converted from Provisional Rating to Final Rating) Corporate Credit Rating Crisil AAA/Stable (Converted from Provisional Rating to Final Rating) Note: None of the Directors on Crisil Ratings Limited’s Board are members of rating committee and thus do not participate in discussion or assignment of any ratings. The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings. 1 crore = 10 million Refer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities Detailed Rationale Crisil Ratings has converted its provisional rating on the non convertible debentures and corporate credit rating of Capital Infra Trust (CIT) to a final rating of ‘Crisil AAA/Stable’. CIT is an infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) comprising roads sector assets sponsored by Gawar Construction Ltd (GCL, or sponsor) with Gawar Investment Manager Pvt Ltd (GIMPL) as its investment manager, GCL as the project manager and Axis Trustee Services Ltd as the trustee. The rating action follows receipt of the required documents and completion of the following pending steps: Completion of the offer and listing of the InvIT: CIT completed its listing and was listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE) on January 17, 2025. Transfer of the shareholding in proposed special purpose vehicles (SPVs) to the InvIT: CIT has acquired the entire shareholding of all the 9 project SPVs. List of SPVs is mentioned in the ‘About the company’ section Refinancing of debt of underlying SPVs with proposed debt: CIT has refinanced the entire debt of the underlying SPVs with fresh Unit issue of Rs 1077 crore and debt of Rs 2363 crore (drawn in two tranches out of sanctioned debt of Rs 2,400 crore). There are no major changes in the key terms of the InvIT debt and the same are in line with details provided to Crisil Ratings at the time of the assigning of ratings and extension of the provisional rating on December 30, 2024. The debt protection metrics remain comfortable. There have been certain modifications in the terms of the  financing documents vis-à-vis at the time of assignment of provisional rating on December 30, 2024. These are highlighted below: Debt amount has been reduced from up to Rs 2,400 crore to up to Rs 2,363 crore The rate of interest for issue 1 now is 7.75% p.a. (from 7.73% p.a. earlier) and is fixed for 3 years (annual reset thereafter), while interest for issue 2 is 7.60% p.a. (from 7.75% earlier) with an annual reset thereafter from allotment date. Provisions for put and call options are still in place. For issue 1, put and call options are available 3 years after allotment date (annually thereafter) while for issue 2, the put and call options are available 1 year after allotment date and annually thereafter. These terms are interchanged from earlier for each of the issues. Crisil Ratings believes that the above changes will not have a material impact on the credit risk profile of the trust and debt protection metrics are expected to remain comfortable. While the provision for put and call options will expose the trust to refinancing risk, it is expected to be mitigated by strong DSCR and balance concession life of ~13 years. The rating continues to reflect a strong and diversified portfolio of nine hybrid annuity model (HAM) road assets which got transferred to the trust by the sponsor, GCL. The portfolio will have a steady revenue profile, supported by the operational track record of assets receiving at least two annuities. The portfolio also has strong counterparty, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI; ‘Crisil AAA/Stable’) for all the assets. These factors, coupled with adequate leverage of debt to enterprise value (EV) of less than 49%, will result in comfortable debt protection metrics. Terms of the  financing documents stipulate maintenance of three-month debt service reserve account (DSRA) and cash trap if the debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) falls below 1.15 times, cushioning liquidity. It also stipulates put and call option every year for issue 2 and three years from date of allotment and annually thereafter for issue 1. While the provision for put and call option will expose the trust to refinancing risk, it is expected to be mitigated by strong DSCR and balance concession life of ~13 years. The rating also reflects predictability of cash flows due to the fixed price operations and maintenance (O&M) and major maintenance (MM) contract between GCL (project manager) and respective SPVs. GCL is a reputed player in the road construction industry with experience in constructing and maintaining road assets. These strengths are partially offset by susceptibility to volatility in operating cost, interest rates and the possibility of increasing leverage for future acquisitions. Analytical Approach Crisil Ratings has combined the business and financial risk profiles of CIT and its underlying SPVs, in line with its criteria for rating entities in homogeneous groups. This is because the trust has direct control over the SPVs and has infused funds in them (in the form of InvIT loans) to repay debt. Furthermore, the SPVs will distribute their surplus cash flow to the InvIT in the form of interest, repayment (on the InvIT loan), dividend and capital reduction, leading to highly fungible cash flow. Also, as per SEBI regulations, the cap on borrowings has been defined at a consolidated level. Please refer Annexure - List of Entities Consolidated, which captures the list of entities considered and their analytical treatment of consolidation. Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description Strengths: Healthy operational track record of assets with geographic diversification: The portfolio comprises nine HAM assets, which have an operational track record of receiving at least two annuities and runs across seven states. Additionally, no HAM asset is contributing more than 25% to the total income of the InvIT and the balance concession period for the assets ranges from 10 to 14 years, which will provide long-term cash inflow to the InvIT. The counterparty of all the assets is NHAI, which reduces the counterparty risk. Additionally, due to the inherent benefits of HAM projects, the traffic risk has been assumed by NHAI providing stability and predictability in cash flow. Payments from NHAI (annuity, interest on annuity and O&M payments) for seven out of the nine projects have been received without any material deduction with an average delay of less than a month. Two projects - Gawar Bangalore Highways Pvt Ltd (GBHPL) and Gawar Nainital Highways Pvt Ltd (GNHPL-II) have received provisional commercial operations date (PCOD) and are under construction, leading to procedural delays in receipt of annuity payments. Timely receipt of future annuities without any material deductions will remain monitorable going forward. Healthy debt protection metrics, with provision for cash trap and creation of DSRA: The financial risk profile will be driven by comfortable average DSCR throughout the tenure of the debt given the expectation of steady annuity receipts and moderate leverage expected at the trust level. As the entire debt is at the trust level, debt servicing will be supported by cash flow pooling of all projects under the InvIT structure. As per the InvIT guidelines, debt must not exceed 49% of the asset value; this is also built into the term sheet. The initial portfolio is estimated to have leverage of around 43% with debt of ~Rs 2,363 crore which has been used for refinancing the project debt at SPVs. The proposed debt terms also require adequate liquidity cushion in the form of three-month DSRA and cash trap if DSCR falls below 1.15 times. It also stipulates put and call option every year for issue 2 and three years from date of allotment and annually thereafter for issue 1. While the provision for put and call option will expose the trust to refinancing risk, it is expected to be mitigated by strong DSCR and balance concession life of ~13 years. The estimated DSCR for the rated debt instruments is strong and expected to remain well above the covenants throughout the debt tenure. While the expected leverage and coverage ratios remain comfortable for the current portfolio of HAM projects, any significant change in composition of the portfolio due to addition of toll assets will remain monitorable. Fixed-price long-term maintenance agreements with GCL: The acquired HAM assets have executed fixed-price O&M and MM contracts with GCL for the entire concession period. Any increase in O&M costs higher than stipulated in the agreement will be borne by GCL, resulting in stability in the cash flow of InvIT. Further, the contract cannot be terminated by GCL for the initial 5 years, which provides additional comfort. The trust will benefit from the strong asset management ability of the sponsor, GCL. It is an infrastructure development and construction company in India, with over 15 years of experience, primarily engaged in the construction of road and highway projects across 19 states in India for various government/semi-government bodies and statutory authorities. Since 2008, it has undertaken more than 100 road construction projects. GCL has a portfolio of 26 road HAM with NHAI, of which 11 are completed projects. Weakness: Susceptibility to volatility in operational costs, interest rates: Trust is exposed to risks related to maintenance of the project stretches. If the prescribed standards are not met, annuity payment may be reduced. Any significant delay and deduction in annuities could impact the project's debt-servicing capability. Furthermore, as operating costs depend on inflation, any significant increase in these components could impact cash flow. Nonetheless, a fixed-price agreement with GCL for maintenance of the stretches for full concession period is expected to mitigate this risk and help in effective maintenance of assets. Also, along with fixed annuities, the projects will receive interest payments on the balance annuities that are linked to the prevailing bank rate. The reduction in bank rate impacts inflow given that a large proportion of the cash inflow is from the interest on balance annuities. However, this is partially offset by the fact that the interest rate on debt is floating and is also expected to follow the trend in bank rates. The possibility of higher leverage (after fulfilling the criteria of six continuous distributions and maintaining external credit rating of AAA) may impact the coverage indicators of CIT. However, the risk is mitigated by the management articulation of maintaining the leverage levels in line with the initial debt-to-EV of ~49% going forward as well. Liquidity: Superior Annuity receipts will comfortably cover operational expenses and debt obligations. Furthermore, DSRA equivalent to interest and principal obligations of three months will be maintained. Liquidity will be supported by the cash trap provision if DSCR falls below 1.15 times. While the provision for put and call option will expose the trust to refinancing risk, it is expected to be mitigated by strong DSCR and balance concession life of ~13 years. Outlook: Stable CIT will continue to benefit from the steady and timely receipt of annuities by the SPVs backed by strong counterparty. Rating sensitivity factors Downward factors Substantial and sustained delay in receipt of subsequent annuities, or considerable deduction in annuities and O&M payments, or significantly higher-than-expected maintenance cost Higher-than-expected incremental borrowings or debt-funded acquisition without commensurate revenue potential impacting overall DSCR Non-adherence to the structural features of the transaction, such as DSRA equivalent to 3 months About Trust CIT (erstwhile National Infrastructure Trust) established on September 25, 2023 is registered as an irrevocable trust under the Indian Trust Act, 1882, and as an InvIT under the SEBI Infrastructure Investment Trust Regulations, 2014, since March 7, 2024 (updated registration certificate issued by SEBI on October 16, 2024).

Rationale and key rating drivers
Ratings assigned to bank facilities of The Anup Engineering Limited (Anup) continue to derive strength from its experienced
promoters, established track record in the critical process equipment industry and its reputed clientele. Ratings also continue to
factor Anup’s strong financial risk profile marked by low leverage, comfortable debt coverage indicators, healthy profitability, and
strong liquidity. CARE Ratings Limited (CARE Ratings) also takes cognisance of sustained strong growth in revenue in FY24 (FY
refers to April 01 to March 31) and expectation of further growth in the medium term supported by healthy order book and
commencement of new manufacturing facility at Kheda near Ahmedabad. Ratings further factor expected synergies from
acquisition of 100% equity stake in Mabel Engineering Private Limited (MEPL), a company in Tamil Nadu and engaged in
manufacturing vessels and silos, through product diversification and geographical diversification.
However, Anup’s long-term rating, remain tempered by its moderate scale of operations relative to other capital goods industry
players, high working capital intensity marked by elongated operating cycle, and concentration of its order-book towards few
products and the end-user industry.
Rating sensitivities: Factors likely to lead to rating actions
Positive factors
• Significant increase in its total operating income (TOI) to around ₹800 crore through greater diversification of its revenue
stream with PBILDT margin in excess of 22% on a sustained basis.
• Contraction of its gross operating cycle (inventory plus debtors) to less than 150 days on a sustained basis along with
maintaining its comfortable leverage.
Negative factors
• Decline in its PBILDT margin to below 18% on a sustained basis.
• Elongation in its operating cycle to around 250 days on a sustained basis along with adverse impact on its liquidity.
• Higher than envisaged debt-funded capex/investment plan or elongation in its working capital leading to significant
deterioration in its leverage and moderation in its return indicators.
Analytical approach: Consolidated.
While assessing Anup’s credit profile, CARE Ratings has considered the standalone profile of Anup along with its recently acquired
subsidiary in June 2024, MEPL. The list of entities whose financials have been consolidated in Anup is mentioned in Annexure-6.
CARE Ratings had previously considered the standalone financials of Anup post the merger of its only subsidiary; Anup Heavy
Engineering Limited (AHEL) with Anup with effect from April 01, 2022.
Outlook: Stable
Stable outlook reflects CARE Ratings’ expectation that Anup shall maintain its strong operational performance backed by an
established track record and strong revenue visibility. Stable outlook also reflects sustenance of its healthy profitability, debt
coverage indicators and capital structure.

Detailed description of key rating drivers:
Key strengths
Experienced promoter group along with established track record in the process equipment industry
Anup’s promoters have vast experience of around six decades in managing different businesses. Sanjay Lalbhai, Chairman of
Anup, is also the Chairman and Managing Director of Arvind Limited (Arvind; rated: CARE AA-; Stable/ CARE A1+). Anup has a
track record of nearly six decades in design and fabrication of process equipment and engineering goods since its incorporation
in 1962. Anup is an ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018 certified company. Anup also possesses certifications
from PESO (Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation) and IBR (Indian Boiler Regulations). Anup’s products are approved by
all major third-party inspection agencies, project management consultants and engineering project consultants such as Engineers
India Limited, Project Development India Limited, Jacob H&G Limited, ThyssenKrupp Industrial Solutions (India) Private
Limited, Air products USA, Toyo Japan, Saipem, Linde Germany and Technip France among others. Further, Anup has also
acquired “U”, “U2”, “S” & “R” stamp authorisation certifications issued by American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) to
penetrate export market (ASME product certification mark complies with the laws and regulations of nearly 100 countries as a
means of meeting their government safety regulations).
Reputed clientele limiting counterparty risk
Anup’s products mainly cater to the industries including refineries, petrochemical, fertilizer, and power generation plants among
others. Anup established its presence in the niche Helical Baffle heat exchanger known as ‘Helixchanger’ under license from
Lummus Technology LLC, USA. Anup has established relationship with reputed customers due to the quality of its products and
adherence to delivery schedules. It has been adding new clientele in domestic and export markets over the years. Anup’s clientele
includes Reliance Industries Limited (rated: CARE AAA; Stable/ CARE A1+), Indian Oil Corporation Limited, Numaligarh Refinery
Limited, GAIL (India) Limited (rated: CARE AAA; Stable/ CARE A1+), Toyo Engineering Limited (rated: CARE A+; Stable/ CARE
A1+), and Nayara Energy Limited (rated: CARE AA-; Stable/ CARE A1+) among others. Majority of Anup’s clientele enjoy healthy
financial risk profile thereby reducing counterparty risk.
Sustained growth in TOI in FY24, which is likely to continue in the medium term
After reporting strong revenue growth of over 40% in FY23, the company’s scale of operation marked by TOI grew healthy by
34% in FY24 to ₹550 crore backed by efficient execution of order book and commencement of new manufacturing facility at
Kheda in September 2023. Anup expects extension of the second bay at Kheda to be operational in Q2FY25. In March 2024, Anup
entered into a definitive share purchase agreement to acquire 100% stake in MEPL at cost of ₹33 crore. Subsequently, Anup
acquired MEPL in June 2024. The acquisition gives an added product portfolio along with increase geographical reach in South
India. In FY24, Mabel reported TOI of around ₹50 crore with PBILDT margin of around 18%. Anup has delayed capex of Phase-
II under Kheda facilities, which would have entailed cost of around ₹120 crore. Hence, acquisition enabled Anup to increase its
capacity instantly within lower-than-earlier envisaged cost of expansion at the Kheda facility. Hence, revenue and profitability in
FY25 are expected to remain higher-than-earlier-envisaged. TOI is expected to grow healthy by over 30% in FY25 on a y-o-y
basis supported by strong order book of around ₹900 crore as on June 15, 2024, which is at its all-time high for the company.
An improved order book along with additional capacity could be a catalyst for sustainable growth in its scale of operations going
forward.
Healthy profitability margins and return indicators
Anup has been maintaining healthy PBILDTs margin of over 20% over past many years despite volatility in commodity prices
backed by strict control over its overheads coupled with efficient management of order book and product mix. Anup’s technical
expertise and specialized products like ‘Helixchanger’ and ‘Embaffle Heat Exchangers’ offer significant benefits over conventional
heat exchangers which is expected to support its profitability. With stabilization of commodity prices and growth in scale of
operations, Anup reported PBILDT margin of 23% in FY24 (FY23: 20%). Anup’s return on capital employed (ROCE) stood healthy
at 22.73% in FY24 (FY23: 16.29%). CARE Ratings expects Anup to maintain PBILDT margins of over 21-22% in the medium term
with growing scale of operations, while ROCE is expected to remain healthy at over 20%.
Low leverage and comfortable debt coverage indicators
Anup has a comfortable capital structure marked by overall gearing ratio of 0.36x (considering letter of credit backed creditors
and mobilisation advances as part of debt) as on March 31, 2024 (0.29x as on March 31, 2023) on account of minimum reliance
on external borrowings. Increase in the debt level in FY24 as against FY23 was mainly due to higher mobilisation advances backed
by increase in share of exports. CARE Ratings expects overall gearing of Anup to remain below 0.50x with no debt funded capex
plans in the medium term.
Debt coverage indicators marked by PBILDT interest coverage, total debt to PBILDT and total debt to gross cash accruals
(TD/GCA) continued to remain comfortable in FY24 as well backed by healthy profitability. CARE Ratings expects debt coverage

indicators to remain comfortable in the medium term on account of expectation of healthy profitability and continued low reliance
on external debt.
Favourable industry outlook
Anup is engaged in manufacturing/fabrication of process equipment mainly for oil refineries, petrochemical plants, fertilizer plants,
and chemical plants among others. Anup’s growth prospects depend on new and maintenance capex budgets of entities engaged
in these industries. Outlook for oil and gas industry is expected to remain stable in the medium term on account of post-pandemic
recovery and government spending in infrastructure supporting industries. The union budget has proposed a capital outlay of
₹1,18,500 crore for oil and gas companies in FY25, an 11% increase over the budgeted estimate for FY24. This is likely to benefit
engineering and engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) companies operating in the oil and gas industry. The
management expects more opportunities from blue hydrogen especially from the western part of the world. The share of
petrochemical production is expected to increase with evolution of new technologies, especially in crude and chemicals.
Liquidity: Strong
Despite its large working capital requirement to support its elongated operating cycle, Anup’s liquidity remains strong marked by
almost negligible utilisation of its fund based working capital limits, healthy cash-flow from operations of ₹168 crore in FY24
(FY23: ₹31 crore) and cash and liquid investments of around ₹168 crore as on March 31, 2024 (₹40 crore to be utilised for
dividend payment and ₹30-35 crore toward acquisition of MEPL). Moreover, the utilisation of its non-fund-based limits stood at
around 76% for the past 12 months ending April 2024. Anup’s envisaged cash accruals, unutilised fund based working capital
limits, and its existing liquidity are sufficient to meet its capex and incremental working capital requirements. Anup’s liquidity is
expected to remain strong backed by its healthy cash accruals and access to unutilised limits in the medium term. Additionally,
existing low leverage also provides sufficient headroom to borrow.
Key weaknesses
Moderate scale of operations
Despite growth in TOI, the company’s scale of operations remained moderate relative to other capital good industry players due
to its limited product offerings. Capacity constraint at its manufacturing facility (inability to handle equipment with weight more
than 200 tons) had also restricted its scale of operations till FY23. The new manufacturing facility has the capacity to handle
equipment with maximum weight of 800 tons to 1,000 tons thereby enabling growth in scale of operation by handling large size
equipment and export orders more efficiently. Further, MEPL’s acquisition complement Anup’s existing product portfolio and aid
in geographical diversification apart from providing additional capacities.
Working capital intensive nature of operations
Anup’s operating cycle improved to 164 days in FY24 (181 days in FY23) mainly supported by improvement in its collection period
to 91 days in FY24 (FY23: 120 days). Anup’s management has articulated about maintaining a policy to buy raw material for a
particular order as soon as the order is received to protect itself from raw material price volatility. At any point of time, Anup
holds inventory of around 30% of the outstanding order-book. All inventories are mapped to specific orders thereby reducing
saleability risk. Anup receives interest free advances from its customers which keeps Anup’s external fund-based borrowing
requirement low. These customer advances are against financial bank guarantee (BG) furnished by Anup. Anup’s customer
advances increased to ₹151 crore as on March 31, 2024 (₹72 crore as on March 31, 2023) largely owing to rise in export orders
as export orders entail around 40% advances as compared to advances of around 25-30% for domestic orders. Further, Anup
needs to submit performance BG to its customers for release of retention money. These keep Anup’s requirement of non-fund
based working capital limits high. Timely enhancement of its non-fund based working capital limits to keep up with expected
increase in its order-book and increasing order execution remains one of key monitorable.
Concentration of order book towards few products and end-user industry
Of the total unexecuted order with Anup as on March 31, 2024, 67% were for manufacturing heat exchangers and 12% were for
manufacturing pressure vessels (PY: 77% for heat exchangers and 15% for pressure vessels), which reflects product
concentration. However, these products are not standardised and are manufactured according to the specific customer
requirement. Further, its order book is also moderately concentrated in terms of end-user industry of its products as nearly 58%
of unexecuted orders are from oil refining and petrochemical industry. Any significant downturn in capex cycle of the refining
industry may restrict order-inflow for the company. Cyclicity in terms of project investments by these industries may impact Anup
in case of concentration of end-user industries. However, Anup has diversified its orderbook with increase in share from exports
and hydrogen segment.

Press Release
Susceptible to volatile raw material prices
Metal (mild steel and stainless-steel) sheets, plates, tubes, pipes, and other components are basic raw materials used by Anup
for fabrication of process equipment. Inherent volatility in their prices could impact Anup’s profitability as orders generally don’t
contain price escalation clause. Prices are driven primarily by the existing demand and supply conditions with strong linkages to
the global market. This results into risk of price fluctuations on the inventory of raw materials and finished goods. However, Anup
generally undertakes back-to-back arrangement for booking of raw materials against its orders, which mitigates raw material
price fluctuation risk to large extent. However, Anup is exposed to volatility in raw material price between submission of price
quotation and receipt of orders.

Infomerics Valuation and Rating Private Limited has reaffirmed the ratings assigned to the
bank facilities of Omax Auto Limited (OAL) at IVR BB-/Stable to long term bank facilities
and IVR A4 to the short-term facilities and simultaneously withdrawn the ratings with
immediate effect. The above action has been taken at the request of OAL and ‘No Objection
Certificate’ received from all the bankers who have extended the facilities, and which is rated
by Infomerics. The rating is withdrawn in accordance with Infomerics’ Policy on Withdrawal
of ratings.
Key Rating Sensitivities: Not Applicable as ratings withdrawn.
List of Key Rating Drivers with Detailed Description
Key Rating Strengths
Experienced Promoters
The promoters, Mr. Jatender Kumar Mehta (Vice Chairman) and Bharat Kaushal (Chairman)
has a vast experience of around three decades in the field of Automobile and its components
Industry. Further, Mr. Devashish Mehta (Managing Director) has rich experience of around a
1
decade. Extensive experience of the promoters underpins the business risk profile of the
company and supports it to develop established relationship with its customers which enabled
the company to receive repeat orders.
Omax's healthy market share with TML
Omax has healthy market share with Tata Motors Limited (TML), both in long-member
manufacturing and frame assembly for medium and heavy trucks, and buses, as well as for
frame assembly of intermediate CV running on compressed natural gas. Further, TML is major
customer of Omax.
Improvement in scale of operations
The total operating income of the company has witnessed growth of ~24.00% during FY23.
TOI improved to Rs. 300.78 crore in FY23 from Rs. 222.20 crore in FY22 driven by
commencement of production at Long Member Plant.
Key Rating Weaknesses
Deterioration in operating margins
The profitability of company in terms of absolute EBITDA has improved at Rs. 13.83 crore in
FY23 as against Rs. (-25.12) crore in FY22. However, the company has reported loss i.e Rs. (-
24.33) crore (-7.71%) in FY23 as against Rs. 23.46 crore (9.25%) in FY22. During FY22, the
company has reported profit majorly on account of gain from sale of properties.
Average financial risk profile
Omax has moderate capital structure as indicated by tangible net worth base of Rs. 277.53 core
as on March 31, 2023, as against Rs. 295.82 crore as on March 31, 2022; this decline is on
account of loss reported during FY23. The overall gearing ratio improved at 0.45x in FY23
from 0.51x in FY22. This improvement is on account of debt reduction in FY23. The debt
protection metrics of the company remained stretched with interest coverage ratio below
average in FY23.
2
High customer concentration risk
The company’s revenue from its major customers’ accounts for ~95.00%, thereby indicating
very high customer concentration risk. If the company loses any of its top customers, then
performance of the company might be impacted over the medium term. However, the risk can
be mitigated as major clients are government bodies and reputed Tata group.

Liquidity – Streched
The company’s liquidity stood stretched with low gross cash accruals of Rs.4.30 crore in FY23
against its debt repayment of Rs. 45.06 crore. However, the company’s cashflows are supported
by promoters fund and by asset sale proceeds. Further, debt obligations repayments are being
done through the same. The company has a current ratio of 0.76x as of March 31, 2023, which
stands below benchmark. The company had cash and bank balance of Rs.30.03 crore as on
March 31, 2023.

Details of instruments/facilities in Annexure-1.
Rationale and key rating drivers
Revision in the ratings assigned to the bank facilities of Coastal Corporation Limited (CCL) is driven by deterioration in the financial
performance of the company during FY24 and 9MFY25 (FY refers to the period from April 01 to March 31) along with increase in
the working capital borrowings. Furthermore, the ratings are tempered by geographical concentration risk, highly competitive
business, dependence on climatic conditions and presence in a regulated industry.
The subsidiary of CCL has undertaken to setting up ethanol plant backed by term loan, the project has seen delay in
implementation. Timely completion of the project and stabilisation of production to generate adequate cash flows to repay debt
starting from January 2025 is critical from the credit perspective. Any reliance on support from CCL shall weaken its financial
profile.
The ratings derive strength from experienced management with a long track record, moderate operational performance,
geographical advantage due to presence in the aquaculture zone, improvement in TOI, and stable industry outlook.
Rating sensitivities: Factors likely to lead to rating actions
Positive factors
• Improvement in overall gearing to below 1.0x and TD/GCA below 3x, going forward.
• PBILDT margin improved to more than 9% while consistent growth in TOI by more than 30%
• Stabilisation of ethanol plant with generation of adequate cash flow to support its obligations.
Negative factors
• Overall gearing deteriorates beyond 1.50x, going forward.
• Significant decline in TOI by more than 30% y-o-y and decline in the PBILDT margins below 6%
• Delay in project implementation leading to cost overrun.
Analytical approach: Consolidated. The list of companies consolidated is attached as Annexure-6.
Consolidated business and financial risk profiles of CCL and its wholly owned subsidiaries namely
• Continental Fisheries India Pvt Ltd (to export marine products)
• Seacrest Seafoods Inc. (USA) (To sell sea foods in the American markets)
• Coastal Bio-Tech Pvt Ltd (To manufacture ethanol)
Outlook: Stable
CARE Ratings believes that the entity will continue to benefit from the extensive experience of the promoters in the industry.
Detailed description of key rating drivers:
Key weaknesses
Moderate capital structure and profitability
CCL’s capital structure has deteriorated as on March 31, 2024. The company’s overall gearing moderated from 0.72x in FY23 to
1.28x in FY24 due to increase in total debt. The company’s major debt is working capital where utilisation is expected to remain
high because of working capital-intensive business and term loan which was availed due to ongoing capex for set-up of ethanol
plant and upgradation of capacity. The company’s coverage indicators deteriorated because of lower accruals marred by higher
interest cost. The company’s PBILDT interest coverage ratio declined and stood moderate at 2.12x in FY24 against 2.55x in FY23.
Other debt coverage indicator, such as the company’s TD/GCA, declined and continues to be moderate at 18.54x in FY24 (9.24x
in FY23).
Elongated operating cycle despite improved and working capital intensive operations
CCL operates in the industry where requirement of working capital is very high. The company procures raw material from local
suppliers and agents which it later processes and exports to countries. The average collection period has been around 30-45 days
which is better than its competitors. However, the company’s working capital cycle has moderated from 111 days in FY22 to 163
days and 164 days in FY24 and FY24 due to increase in inventory level given the high transit time as an impact of red sea crisis,

Press Release
where the company had to reroute its transits. The utilisation of fund based working capital limits for the last 12 months ending
January 31, 2025, stood high at 93%.
Geographical concentration risk: CCL is a 100% export-oriented unit. CCL’s customer base is concentrated majorly in the
USA, which contributes around 85% followed by China, South Korea, Japan and others. This dependency has led to decline in
the profitability margins during FY24 and 9MFY25 due to imposition of countervailing duty by the US government. The company
has already started to export Russia and Japan the benefits of the same holds significance for CCL’s profitability.
Presence in a highly competitive industry: The seafood industry is exposed to intense competition as there are several small
and large players. The players also face intense competition from south-east Asian exporters impacting the realizations. The
seafood export segment is marked by stringent regulations and quality requirements. Many of the export destinations, such as
the USA, Japan, and European countries, implement timely regulations (including anti-dumping duty, food safety regulations, and
quality requirements) that need to be complied with.
Vulnerability to adverse changes in export incentives, international trade policies and forex risk: CCL’s profitability
is supported by the export incentives received from the GoI. The GoI replaced the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS)
with the Remission of Duties and Taxes on Export Products (RoDTEP) scheme in January 2021. The rate of incentive for CCLs
under RoDTEP is 2.5% against 5% which was received earlier under MEIS. Such changes in export incentives may impact the
margin players in the industry. Also, adverse, or unfavourable changes in the trade policies of the importing countries may affect
the business profile of the company. Additionally, the company remains exposed to forex fluctuation risks in the absence of formal
hedging policy.
Disease-prone industry with dependence on climatic conditions: Shrimp farming being an agro commodity is exposed to
climatic conditions. Production and raw material prices tend to fluctuate and may depend on the vagaries of nature. Furthermore,
shrimp farming is disease prone as there are a variety of lethal viral and bacterial diseases that affect shrimp. However, after
repeated tests, Vannamei shrimps have been observed to be more resistant than Black Tiger to various diseases. Moreover, there
has not been any major disease outbreak for the past decade in the Indian seafood sector.
Unrelated Diversification: The company has set up a 100% subsidiary named Coastal Biotech Pvt Ltd for Ethanol
manufacturing with a capacity of 198 KLPD in Odisha. The estimated capex is around ₹156 crore which will be funded through
debt: equity mix of 60:40. The project has seen delay in execution which has led to limiting the financial flexibility of the company,
which already deteriorated due to lower profitability in the shrimp business. The upcoming ethanol plant is expected to navigate
its operations under volatile raw material prices, regulated selling prices and any adverse movement in the policies that may result
in deterioration in the CCL’s profitability.
Key strengths
Qualified management and satisfactory track record in the aquaculture industry: Mr. T. Valsaraj, Managing Director,
is at the helm of the affairs of the company. He has a high degree of involvement in the day-to-day operations of the company
right from sourcing orders to final delivery. He is well supported by a highly experienced and professional team. The company
has developed a long-standing relationship with the USA and European importers over the last decade. CCL has also developed
a strong network of suppliers for aqua-cultured products, majorly Vannamei shrimps, throughout the aqua-cultured zone in
Godavari District of Andhra Pradesh.
Geographical advantage due to the presence in the aquaculture zone in Andhra Pradesh: CCL has three processing
units which are located in the prime aquaculture zone near the coastal area of Andhra Pradesh, which enables the company to
procure raw materials and process them immediately after harvest. The purchases are made from all the major coastal regions
of A.P. viz. Srikakulam, Tuni, Kakinada, Amalapuram, Bhimavaram, Narasapuram, Machilipatnam, Repalle, Ongole and Nellore.
Apart from these places, CCL also procures from Gujarat and Orissa during May-July and August-November seasons every year.
Government support to aqua industry:
In the last financial year (2023-24), India exported 17,81,602 metric tonne (MT) seafood worth ₹60,523.89 crore (US$7.38 billion)
which is all time high exports by value. As for overseas markets, the USA continued to be the major importer of Indian seafood
in value terms, with an import worth US$2,549.15 million, accounting for a share of 34.53% in terms of US$ value. The export
increased by 1.42% in ₹, and 7.46% in quantity however, they declined by 3.15% in US$ terms throughout the course of FY24.
The increase is mostly, considering increase in export of frozen shrimps accounting for a share of 41% in quantity and 67.72%
of the total US$ earnings. To support the fisheries sector Honourable Prime Minister of India launched the Pradhan Mantri Matsya
Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) on 10th September 2020 to “transform” the fisheries sector and add strength to the efforts of building
an ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’. The PMMSY is a flagship scheme for focused and sustainable development of the fisheries sector in the
country. The scheme is aiming to support farmers with assistance and hence it is envisaged that the scheme will help in doubling
the income of farmers. Also, being an export-oriented entity CCL is eligible for financial incentives such as ‘Duty Drawback’ and
Remission of Duties or Taxes on Export Products (RoDTEP). Starting 1 January 2021, the Indian government announced a new
WTO-compliant scheme called Remission of Duties or Taxes on Export Product (RoDTEP) which has replaced MEIS. Although
there is a tad reduction in the percentage of benefit for exporters, the impact of the same is shared across the value chain and
thus the profitability margins of exporters are expected to remain stable.
2 CARE Ratings Ltd.
Press Release
Moderate operational performance with few ongoing and some completed capex: The capacity utilization levels of the
company have declined and stood at 60% for the past three-year period that ended March 2024. Given increasing demand, the
company has set up an additional processing plant (Unit-III) with a capacity of 35 MT/day at KSEZ, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh
funded through a debt: equity mix of 25:75. The plant commenced commercial operations in May 2022. The company is planning
to upgrade its capacity more with an additional Unit-IV at Odisha with 12MTPD which is under execution. The sales realization
moderated to ₹ 6.45 lakh/MT during FY24 as against ₹ 7.15 lakh/MT during FY23, though the volume has improved by around
38%.
In 9MFY25 CCL has sold total of 6560.75 MT with a sales value of ₹ 456.57 crore. The sales realization in 9MFY25 stood at ₹
6.976 Lakh/MT. The raw material price stood at ₹ 3.13 Lakh/MT in 9MFY25.
Marginal improvement in TOI although moderate profitability during FY24 and 9MFY25:
The total operating income (TOI) of CCL witnessed a marginal improvement of 21.60% from ₹361.59 crore in FY23 to ₹439.71
crore in FY24. The improvement in the revenue of the company was majorly due increase in volume of sales due to demand in
shrimp although realisations have moderated due to recessionary trends in USA. The PBILDT margins, however, moderated at
7.39% in FY24 on account of lower processing costs, decrease in sales realizations and a decline in freight expenses. Thus, even
with a higher TOI, the company reported ₹4.52 crore PAT and PBILDT of ₹32.49 crore in FY24 as compared to ₹6.70 and 28.70
crore in FY23. Further, the PAT margins declined to 1.03% in FY24 as against 1.85% in FY23. At absolute levels, the PAT of the
company stood at ₹4.52 crore in FY24 as against ₹6.70 crore in FY23. Due to higher interest costs of ₹15.33 crore the profit levels
were significantly lower than FY23 and FY22.
In 9MFY25 the CCL has achieved a TOI of ₹ 477.82 crores which is ~47% increase when compared to 9MFY24 which saw revenue
of ₹ 323.98 crore. Although, the PBILDT margin moderated from 10.70% in 9MFY24 to 6.85% in 9MFY25 due to lower sales
realisations coupled with levy of CVD charges and PBILDT on absolute terms (₹ 32.72 crore in 9MFY25). Further the PAT margins
declined TO 1.15% in 9MFY25 as against 4.62% in 9MFY24. At absolute levels the PAT stood at ₹ 5.51 crores as compared to ₹
10.71 crores in 9MFY24 due to higher interest cost and higher depreciation.
Long standing association with clientele despite geographical concentration risk
CCL is an export-oriented entity with ~85% of the company’s total income coming from export sales majorly from the USA. This
makes the company vulnerable to single geography for big order. Any unfavourable change in the US government policy like
higher anti-dumping duty or other import restriction will have a major impact on the company’s operational and financial
performance. Although, it may seem like geographical concentration, but the USA is a better margin market and has healthy
future growth prospects for value added products, since the demand for Indian shrimps continues to remain on an upward trend
in the USA. However, CCL has now forayed in Chinese, Russia, Japan and European markets having equally high demand as USA.
However, the margins remain on the lower side when compared to USA. Hence, with presence of over three decades of operations,
the group has successfully cemented its place as one of the India’s major sea food exporters.
Liquidity: Stretched
Liquidity of the company is stretched, though supported by year-end balance of ₹ 42.58 crore against repayment of ₹ 8 crore for
FY25. However, given the working capital-intensive nature of operations, fund-based working capital utilization of the company
in the past 12 months ended January 31,2025, remained high at ~93%. The company has availed temporary overdraft from
existing lenders during the year.

Rating Rationale Rating Rationale December 30, 2024 | Mumbai Exxaro Tiles LimitedRatings downgraded to 'CRISIL BBB-/Negative/CRISIL A3' Rating ActionTotal Bank Loan Facilities RatedRs.122 CroreLong Term RatingCRISIL BBB-/Negative (Downgraded from 'CRISIL BBB/Negative')Short Term RatingCRISIL A3 (Downgraded from 'CRISIL A3+')Note: None of the Directors on CRISIL Ratings Limited’s Board are members of rating committee and thus do not participate in discussion or assignment of any ratings. The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities Detailed Rationale CRISIL Ratings has downgraded its ratings on the bank facilities of Exxaro Tiles Ltd (ETL) to ‘CRISIL BBB-/Negative/CRISIL A3’ from ‘CRISIL BBB/Negative/CRISIL A3+’. The downgrade and continuation of negative outlook reflects the moderation in the business risk profile and weak liquidity. Revenue remained at Rs 70 crore in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and Rs 130 crore in the first half of the year (Rs 83 crore and Rs 157 crore, respectively, in the corresponding periods of the previous fiscal) while operating margins stood at 8.20% and 4.53%, respectively, (9.33% and 9.95%) due to subdued demand, intense competition and low bargaining power with customers. Net cash accrual remained stretched though tightly matched in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and fund-based bank limit utilisation (BLU) remained high over 90% throughout the four months ended October 2024. Accordingly, liquidity could continue to be constrained through fiscal 2025 as well. However, capital structure should improve over the medium term, with expected accretion to reserve and scheduled debt repayment. While operating performance is expected to improve over the medium term amidst strategic decisions undertaken by the management and low impact of aforesaid reasons in coming terms, its timely recovery and sustenance thereafter will remain monitorable. Nevertheless, any further decline in revenue or operating margin, impacting net cash accrual and liquidity, is a key rating sensitivity factor. The ratings continue to reflect the established market presence and comfortable capital structure of ETL. These strengths are partially offset by the modest debt protection metrics, large working capital requirement, and susceptibility to volatile raw material and gas prices, intense competition and cyclicality in the end-user industry. Analytical Approach CRISIL Ratings has evaluated the standalone business and financial risk profiles of ETL. Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description Strengths: Established market presence: ETL has an established market presence, benefiting from the two-decade experience of the promoters, their strong understanding of market dynamics and healthy distribution network. The company has a network of over 800 dealers and 2000+ touch points where its products are sold under the Exxaro brand. It benefits from its production being almost totally in house and sales in its own brand with presence in large-sized tiles. Revenue stood at Rs 70 crore in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and Rs 130 crore in the first half of the year and is expected to improve with capacity utilisation and new arrangements made by the company; however, it will remain a key monitorable. Comfortable capital structure: The company has a comfortable financial profile with networth of Rs 272 crore and gearing of 0.38 time as on September 30, 2024 (Rs 274 crore and 0.43 time, a year earlier), though on account of profit after tax (PAT) loss since a few quarters, the same is declining. Networth is expected to remain comfortable on account of scheduled debt repayment, while gearing is likely to remain below 1 time in the absence of any debt-funded capital expenditure (capex) plan over the medium term. Weaknesses: Modest debt protection metrics: Debt protection measures are modest with interest coverage of 1.05 times and net cash accrual to total debt of 0.01 time in the first half of fiscal 2025 (2.38 times and 0.08 time, respectively, for the corresponding period of the previous fiscal). Moderation in profitability, high borrowing and interest costs/burden restrained interest coverage. With expected revival in business and better profitability, interest coverage ratio should improve over the medium term, but will remain monitorable. Large working capital requirement: Gross current assets have been sizeable at ~417 days as on first half of fiscal 2025, driven by huge inventory of 251 days on account of a wide range of designs and continuous changes in the same with production being largely in-house. Also, the company had debtors of around ~150 days, led by extension of large credit to dealers as on September 30, 2024. Working capital is partially supported by extended credit received from suppliers of ~380 days. While ETL is undertaking measures to control the working capital cycle, the extent and sustenance of improvement remains monitorable. Susceptibility to volatile raw material and gas prices, intense competition and cyclicality in the end-user industry: Raw materials (different types of clay, feldspar, silica, kaolin and carbonates) comprise 35-40% of the total operating cost, while cost of gas and power forms 35-40%. Hence, even a slight variation in input prices will drastically impact profitability. Operating margin remained at 4.53% in the first half of fiscal 2025 (9.95% in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal), though it improved to 8.2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and the same is expected to be maintained over the next few quarters. Profitability was also impacted by sizeable marketing expenditures incurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 for its advertising campaign. Improvement and sustenance of the margin will remain monitorable. ETL caters to the real estate, construction and infrastructure industries, whose performance is strongly correlated with economic cycles. Due to economic recessions in the past, the construction sector faced a slowdown, with several projects getting delayed or cancelled, restraining the performance of ceramic tile manufacturers. Besides, the industry is intensely competitive and dominated by unorganised entities. However, with changes such as closure of ceramic units running on coal gasifiers, and implementation of the Goods and Services Tax and Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, organised players have gained market share in value terms. Despite being an established player in the ceramic tiles industry, the company faces intense competition from both unorganised entities and reputed brands. The ability to pass on any increase in raw material cost, amidst the competitive scenario, remains a key rating sensitivity factor. Any moderation in demand from the real estate sector and its impact on pricing and offtake will be closely monitored. Liquidity: Stretched Bank limit utilisation was high around 92% for fund-based limits and 73% for non-fund based limits for the four months ended October 2024. Net cash accrual was insufficient against debt obligation in the first half of fiscal 2025 and the shortfall was met via working capital limits. In fiscal 2025 too, net cash accrual will be tightly matched against repayment obligation of Rs 7.5 crore. Current ratio was moderate at 1.5 times as on September 30, 2024. The promoters are likely to extend support via equity and unsecured loans to meet the working capital requirement and debt obligation. Outlook: Negative The business risk profile of ETL will continue to weaken, marked by lower-than-expected operating performance, leading to modest cash accrual and stretched liquidity. Rating sensitivity factors Upward factors Considerable rise in revenue with operating margin over 10% leading to higher net cash accrual Decline in working capital intensity and subsequent improvement in financial risk profile, especially liquidity Downward factors Fall in revenue or operating profitability declining below 6.5% over the next few quarters, resulting in lower-than-expected net cash accrual. Further stretch in the working capital cycle, constraining the debt servicing ability of the company. Any large, debt-funded capex About the Company ETL is engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of vitrified tiles that are primarily used as flooring solutions. It was set up fiscal 2008 as a partnership firm that manufactured frit, a raw material used in tile manufacturing and have over the years, diversified, expanded and evolved into a manufacturer of vitrified tiles. It has two units in Gujarat (Unit 1 - Padra in Vadodara and Unit 2- Talod in Sabarkantha) and has total installed capacity of 146 lakh square metre. The company is listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange.

*Instrument details are provided in Annexure-I
Rationale
The revision in the ratings of Oriental Carbon & Chemicals Ltd factors in the business restructuring at the group level, wherein
the chemicals business was demerged into OCCL Ltd., and the investments (including the one in Duncan Engineering Limited)
remained with Oriental Carbon & Chemicals Ltd. For the rating of Oriental Carbon & Chemicals Ltd, ICRA has taken consolidated
the financials of Oriental Carbon & Chemicals Ltd with DEL.
The ratings also factor in the extensive experience of Duncan Engineering Limited (DEL), the subsidiary company of Oriental
Carbon & Chemicals Ltd, in the pneumatic products industry and its established relationships with various customers and
suppliers. Further, the ratings factor in the comfortable debt protection metrics, supported by the company’s adequate
liquidity position. ICRA also notes that Oriental Carbon & Chemicals Ltd has invested a sizeable amount of money in liquid
mutual funds and alternate investment funds and the returns from the same remain susceptible to the performance of the
underlying assets. The ratings are, however, constrained by the small scale of operations, coupled with the limited bargaining
power and stiff competition from large players. The ratings are further constrained by the vulnerability of profitability to the
volatility in key raw material (steel and special alloys) prices.
The Stable outlook factors in ICRA’s expectation of a stable cash generation amid the limited capex plans or debt repayments,
and expectations of DEL’s credit profile to remain healthy, going forward. With low levels of debt, the financial leverage (gross
debt/OPBDITA) was almost nil by the end of FY2024 and is expected to continue to be comfortable, going forward. The interest
coverage ratio was 87.5 times in FY2024 and is expected to improve further on expectations of stable operating profits and
declining interest costs.

Key rating drivers and their description
Credit strengths
Healthy financial risk profile with strong debt protection metrics – Oriental Carbon & Chemicals Ltd’s capitalisation and
coverage indicators have improved significantly over the last few years, despite the significant capex, because of the healthy
cash generation and low reliance on debt. The net debt levels were at Rs. 35.8 crore at the end of FY2024, leading to low net
financial leverage (net debt/OPBDITA) of 0.4 times at the end of FY2024. The interest coverage ratio improved to 8.4 times in
FY2024 vis-à-vis 7.3 times in FY2023. ICRA expects the company’s credit metrics to improve further, given the healthy cash
generation and limited capex planned, going forward.
Stable performance of subsidiary – Duncan Engineering (DEL rated [ICRA]BBB+/ [ICRA]A2, earlier known as Schrader Duncan),
incorporated in 1962, was promoted as a joint venture between Schrader Bridgeport International (SB Intl, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Tomkins Plc) and the Duncan Group (managed by the Goenka family, which is the promoter Group of OCCL). DEL
manufactures pneumatic products such as air cylinders, valves and accessories. OCCL holds a 50.01% stake in DEL, making it a
subsidiary of OCCL. Earlier, OCCL had provided corporate guarantees, backing the bank lines of DEL, but these were withdrawn
in FY2021.
DEL’s operating income moderated to Rs. 65.10 crore in FY2024 from Rs. 70.1 crore in FY2023. The operating profit also
moderated at Rs. 8.9 crore in FY2024 against Rs. 13.2 crore in FY2023 in line with the moderation in operating income. The
entity had a long-term debt of around Rs. 0.4 crore by the end of FY2024 and around Rs. 31.4 crore of cash and other
investments.
Credit challenges
Small scale of operations with limited bargaining power - DEL deals only in pneumatic products used to control air pressure
in various machines. The scale of operations is very limited and, hence, it does not have much bargaining power with suppliers
and customers.
Competition from large established players - The company faces stiff competition from domestic and international players
such as Rotork, Janatics, FMC, Parker etc. However, competitive pricing and good product quality enable DEL to attract repeat
orders from its customers.
Returns from investments subject to market forces and performance of underlying assets – Oriental Carbon & Chemicals
Ltd’s returns from investments are influenced by market forces and the performance of the underlying assets. These factors
determine the value of the investment portfolio, resulting in varying returns based on market conditions, economic factors,
and the specific performance of the assets held. Consequently, the returns may be unpredictable and can report gains or losses
depending on the market environment and asset performance.
Liquidity position: Adequate
Oriental Carbon & Chemicals Ltd’s liquidity is adequate, backed by unencumbered cash balances on a consolidated level.
Moreover, at a standalone level, the company holds investments in liquid mutual funds as well as alternate investment funds.
Rating sensitivities
Positive factors – The ratings may be revised upwards if there is a significant increase in the company’s consolidated scale of
operations and operating profits on a sustained basis while maintaining the liquidity position.
Negative factors – The ratings may be downgraded if there is any significant deterioration in the company’s consolidated
revenue generation and profitability. Any sizeable losses in the investment portfolio can also impact the ratings negatively.

About the company
Oriental Carbon & Chemicals (OCCL) was incorporated in 1978 as Dharuhera Chemicals Limited (DCL). In 1983, DCL was merged
with Oriental Carbon Limited (OCL), a group company engaged in the production of carbon black, to form OCCL. In 1994, OCCL
had set up a manufacturing facility to produce insoluble sulphur, which became its flagship product as the company sold the
carbon black unit to Continental Carbon Company in 2000. The company has three production units: two at Dharuhera
Industrial Unit in Haryana and one at Mundra SEZ in Gujarat. The company produces insoluble sulphur, sulphuric acid and
oleum.
The company undertook a business restructuring exercise under which the chemicals business was demerged into OCCL
Limited, leaving the investment business and Duncan Engineering Limited as a subsidiary with Oriental Carbon & Chemicals
Limited.

Rating Rationale Rating Rationale December 02, 2024 | Mumbai Bhandari Hosiery Exports LimitedRatings upgraded to 'CRISIL BBB/Stable/CRISIL A3+' Rating ActionTotal Bank Loan Facilities RatedRs.125.91 CroreLong Term RatingCRISIL BBB/Stable (Upgraded from 'CRISIL BBB-/Stable')Short Term RatingCRISIL A3+ (Upgraded from 'CRISIL A3')Note: None of the Directors on CRISIL Ratings Limited’s Board are members of rating committee and thus do not participate in discussion or assignment of any ratings. The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities Detailed Rationale CRISIL Ratings has upgraded its ratings on the bank facilities of Bhandari Hosiery Exports Ltd (BHEL) to ‘CRISIL BBB/Stable/CRISIL A3+’ from ‘CRISIL BBB-/Stable/CRISIL A3’. The upgrade factors in the improvement in the business risk profile of the company supported by increase in operating margin to 10.65% in the first half of fiscal 2025 (9.5% in fiscal 2024). This increase was driven by commencement of operations post capital expenditure (capex) for printed fabric from March 2024, leading to an increased share of value-added products. Operating income is expected at Rs 270-280 crore for full fiscal 2025 (Rs 267 crore in fiscal 2024). Improvement in the operating income and sustenance of operating margin above 10% will remain key monitorable. Net cash accrual is expected to be over Rs 15 crore in fiscal 2025. The ratings also factor in the expected improvement in the debt protection metrics, with interest coverage ratio expected around 3 times in fiscal 2025 (2.26 times in fiscal 2024) driven by prepayment of term debt and reduction in working capital utilisation through rights issue of Rs 48 crore in fiscal 2025. The ratings reflect the company’s established market position, backed by the promoters' extensive experience in the textile industry, and comfortable financial risk profile. These strengths are partially offset by susceptibility to volatility in cotton prices and large working capital requirement. Analytical Approach CRISIL Ratings has considered the standalone business and financial risk profiles of BHEL. Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description Strengths: Established market position, and extensive experience of the promoters: The three-decade-long experience of the promoters and the comfortable market position of BHEL in the cotton yarn and grey and denim fabric businesses will continue to support the business. Revenue is expected to grow by 3-5% to Rs 270-280 crore in fiscal 2025 (Rs 267 crore in fiscal 2024); the company has achieved revenue of around Rs 126 crore in the first half of fiscal 2025. Comfortable financial risk profile: The financial risk profile improved following a rights issue, through which BHEL raised Rs 48 crore in August 2024. Networth is expected to improve to above Rs 150 crore as on March 31, 2025 (Rs 105.6 crore as on March 31, 2024). These funds have been utilised for the prepayment of debt (prepayment of ~Rs 15 crore), leading to improvement in the capital structure; gearing is expected to improve to 0.5-0.6 time as on March 31, 2025, from 1.05 times as on March 31, 2024. Reduction in debt, along with improved profitability, will lead to better debt protection metrics. Interest coverage and net cash accrual to adjusted debt ratios are expected around 3 times (2.3 times in fiscal 2024) and 0.2 time (0.1 time in fiscal 2024), respectively, in fiscal 2025. Weaknesses: Large working capital requirement: Operations are working capital intensive, as reflected in gross current assets (GCAs) of 200-230 days over the three fiscals through 2024, driven by inventory of 100-130 days and receivables of 80-90 days. The company maintains a large inventory of yarn, fabric and dyes on account of its diverse product profile. GCAs are expected at 240-250 days as on March 31, 2025. A further stretch in the working capital cycle, weakening the financial risk profile and liquidity, will remain monitorable. Susceptibility to volatility in cotton prices: The cost of the key raw material, cotton, accounts for 80-85% of net sales. Any fluctuation in price because of the vagaries of monsoon could impact profitability. Operating margin was 8-9% over the five fiscals through 2024 as the company is able to pass on an increase in raw material prices to customers, albeit with lag of a quarter. The operating margin is expected to be 10-11% in the near term driven by benefits from sale of printed fabrics. Liquidity: Adequate Net cash accrual, expected at Rs 15-20 crore per annum, will comfortably cover yearly debt obligation of Rs 5.5-6.0 crore over the medium term. Bank limit utilisation was 84% on average for the 12 months through October 2024. Current ratio was 1.48 times and cash and equivalent stood at Rs 1.92 crore as on March 31, 2024. Outlook: Stable BHEL will continue to benefit from the extensive experience of its promoters. Rating sensitivity factors Upward factors Increase in operating income by 30-35% and sustenance of operating margin at 10-11% leading to higher net cash accrual Efficient working capital management Downward factors Decline in revenue or operating profitability leading to lower cash accrual and net cash accrual to repayment obligation ratio below 1.5 times Further stretch in the working capital cycle or large debt-funded capex weakening the financial risk profile and liquidity.

Ind-Ra expects ASSL to benefit from the adoption of managed aggregation (MA) model for its leases with space-owners, reducing the risk of downturn in occupancy or short-term economic cycles. ASSL have generated a revenue from operations of INR5,453 million in FY23 & INR1,877 million in 1QFY24. Net debt levels were negative and the gross debt outstanding as of June 2023 was at INR318 million. Ind-Ra expects ASSL’s revenue from operations to cross INR8,000 million in FY24 and net debt levels to remain negative in the short term.List of Key Rating DriversStrengthsStrong market presenceBusiness strategy; asset light modelDiverse clientele - reduced tenant concentration riskStrong operational performanceAdequate liquidityExperienced promoter and reputed investorsWeaknesses Moderate asset-liability management (ALM) riskSignificant capex requirementsExposure to cyclicality in economic downturnPending litigations against erstwhile investors / group companiesDetailed Description of Key Rating DriversStrong Market Presence: ASSL is the largest flexible workspace operator in India in terms of the number of centres. The company had over 70,000 operational seats as of June 2023 spread across 121 locations with over 3.6 million square feet (msf) of leasable space in 16 cities and 48 micro-markets, thereby leading to a significant network and geographical diversification. ASSL offers its services into various segments - co-working services (Awfis and Awfis Gold), comprehensive design and build solutions (Awfis Transform) and end-to-end property and facility management services (Awfis Care). Robust Business Strategy, Asset-light Model: ASSL has increased the share of centres based on the MA model in its supply mix to more than 60% of the total centres in June 2023 (March 2021: 50%), thereby moving to an asset-light model. The MA model requires the fit-out costs of the centre to be borne by both the space owner and ASSL in exchange for a share in revenue/profits, vis-a-vis the entire fit-out costs being borne by ASSL under straight leases. This shift towards the MA model improved the return on capital employed to about 25% in March 2023 (March 2021: about 11%). Ind-Ra expects the return on capital employed to be around 30% for FY24 and improve going forward with higher adoption of the MA model. Diverse Clientele - Reduced Tenant Concentration Risk: ASSL has a diversified client base of more than 2,100 tenants as of June 2023, which reduced the tenancy risk. The top five clients contributed to less than 14% of total revenue and the top client contributed to less than 5% of total revenue as of June 2023, reducing its tenant concentration risk. The tenant mix is moderately diversified with 47% of tenants being from the information technology industry with exposure to large corporates / multinational companies at about 66% and start-ups at about 10%. Strong Operational Performance: ASSL registered an Ind-Ra-adjusted EBITDA of about INR344 million in FY23 (FY22: INR8million; FY21: INR34 million). Ind-Ra expects the adjusted EBITDA to be INR800-INR900 million by FY24. ASSL has been able to increase the number of operational centres to 119 in March 2023 (March 2021: 58) and the number of operational seats to about 68,000 (about 30,000) and the number of operational centres and operational seats is likely to have exceeded 145 and 84,000 in FY24, respectively. The occupancy rate has also increased to about 75% in March 2023 (March 2021: about 60%) despite the increase in number of operational seats. These operational parameters reflect its strong operational performance and Ind-Ra expects occupancy levels to sustain around 75% over FY24-FY27.  Adequate Liquidity: ASSL’s Ind-Ra-adjusted cash flow from operations was at INR533 million in FY23 and is likely to have remained over INR700 million in FY24. The cash and cash equivalents were INR72 million at 1QFYE24 (FYE23: INR56 million), and the unencumbered fixed deposit balance was at about INR350 million at 1QFYE24 (FYE23: INR212 million). ASSL has a strong balance sheet with negative net debt levels. The total debt was about INR318 million as of 1QFY24 with undrawn bank limits of over INR300 million. Given the low debt levels and scheduled debt repayment (INR95 million in FY25), ASSL’s cash debt service coverage ratio remains robust with an expected cumulative cash debt service coverage ratio of about 5.5x over FY24-FY27. The agency expects the debt-to-rental ratio to be below 1x over the medium term. The company had positive changes in the working capital in FY23, and Ind-Ra expects positive cashflows from net working capital changes in the short to medium term. Experienced Promoter and Reputed Investors: ASSL is promoted by Amit Ramani who is the managing director and chief executive officer.  He has approximately 20 years of experience in the real estate and workplace solutions. ASSL has received investment from several reputed investors including Peak XV (formerly known as Sequoia Capital India), Bisque Limited and Link Investment Trust (Chrys Capital Group), Family office of Havells India Limited (QRG Investments and Holdings Limited), VBAP Holdings Private Limited and Dalmia Bharat Group, Family office of SRF Ltd (Karmav Real Estate Holdings LLP - Arun Bharat Ram Group), Arjun Bhartia (Jubiliant group) and Ashish Kacholia. ASSL raised a net capital of about INR1,200 million in FY23. Moderate ALM Risk:  Cash outflows in the form of lease payments, employee expenses, among others are generally fixed, whereas cash inflows remain volatile due to volatility of occupancy levels. Co-working spaces do not enjoy sticky customers compared established commercial real estate spaces with long-term leases with strong tenants. The weighted average lease tenure of leases with clients is about 33 months compared to 60-120 months with lessors leading to asset liability mismatch in case of non-renewals. Ind-Ra takes comfort from the lock-in period of about 24 months and low monthly net churn rate of 1.18%, which is one of the lowest, as per management estimates.  The scheduled renewals in the next two years remained at 35%-42% as of June 2023. As per the management, the renewal rate was 80%-85% in the past two years ended FY23. The lease agreements typically have a rental reset of 10%-15% every three years for the space-owners and about 5% annually for the tenants. Significant Capex Requirements: ASSL has been expanding its business operations in India and is required to incur fit-out and other fixed costs associated with opening of each new centre. Though the company is moving to the asset-light MA model, ASSL is still required to incur a significant amount towards fit-outs and the same have been funded by cash accruals and investor funding till June 2023. The agency expects the annual capex outflows to be about INR1,200 million-1,300 million in the medium term to be largely funded through internal accruals/ public issue proceeds with low debt component. Exposure to Cyclicality in Economic Downturn: The real estate sector in India is cyclical and volatile, resulting in high fluctuations in cash inflows because of volatility in realisations. Rental collections (key source of revenue) are susceptible to economic downturns, which constrain tenants’ business risk profile and, therefore, occupancy and rental rates. Additionally, about 35% of the company's clientele are small and medium enterprises, start-ups and freelancers and any funding related risk to these can have an adverse impact on the income of ASSL. Any downturn in economic cycles can negatively impact the rental income of ASSL. The cash flow volatility is partly offset by the lock-in clauses and security deposits being stipulated in the tenant leases along with lower fixed rental outflows due to managed aggregation supply side strategy majorly adopted by ASSL resulting into lower profit shares to space-owners in periods of stress and low leverage levels leading to lower debt payments. Pending Litigations against Erstwhile Investors / Group Companies:  Two of ASSL's erstwhile investor entities, namely, DOIT Urban Ventures India Pvt Ltd and RAB Enterprises India Pvt Ltd and erstwhile group companies of ASSL namely, Ncube Planning and Design Pvt Ltd, Petra Asset & Family Management Pvt Ltd and PAFM Security Solutions Pvt Ltd have pending litigations due to their affiliation with the promoter of Yes Bank (‘IND A’/Stable), his family or his affiliated entities. ASSL disassociated itself from these entities in FY24 vide a duly approved scheme of reduction sanctioned by The National Company Law Tribunal, New Delhi, and the relevant promoter also disassociated himself from these entities in FY24 itself as permitted by an arbitral tribunal constituted in proceedings pending between DOIT Urban Ventures, Ncube Planning and Design and the relevant promoter, and they do not expect any material outflows from the pending litigations against these entities. LiquidityAdequate: ASSL’s Ind-Ra-adjusted cash flow from operations was at INR533 million in FY23 and is likely to have remained over INR700 million in FY24. The cash and cash equivalents were INR72 million at 1QFYE24 (FYE23: INR56 million), and the unencumbered fixed deposit balance was at about INR350 million at 1QFYE24 (FYE23: INR212 million). ASSL has a strong balance sheet with negative net debt levels. The total debt was about INR318 million as of 1QFY24 with undrawn bank limits of over INR300 million. Given the low debt levels and scheduled debt repayment (INR95 million in FY25), ASSL’s cash debt service coverage ratio remains robust with an expected cumulative cash debt service coverage ratio of about 5.5x over FY24-FY27. The agency expects the debt-to-rental ratio to be below 1x over the medium term. The company had positive changes in the working capital in FY23, and Ind-Ra expects positive cashflows from net working capital changes in the short to medium term.Rating SensitivitiesPositive: A substantial improvement in the operating profitability, counterparty mix and business profile on a sustained basis with reducing churn rate leading to better cash flow visibility and while maintaining the credit metrics can lead to a positive rating action. Negative: A substantial decline in the operational profitability, deterioration in counterparty mix, an increase in the churn rates and/or unexpected debt-funded capex leading to Ind-Ra-adjusted net leverage (net debt/Ind-Ra-adjusted EBITDA) levels rising 2x can lead to a negative rating action.About the CompanyASSL is a flexible workspace solutions company incorporated in 2014.

Rating Rationale Rating Rationale January 23, 2025 | Mumbai Menon Bearings LimitedRatings reaffirmed at 'Crisil BBB+/Stable/Crisil A2' Rating ActionTotal Bank Loan Facilities RatedRs.20.96 CroreLong Term RatingCrisil BBB+/Stable (Reaffirmed)Short Term RatingCrisil A2 (Reaffirmed)Note: None of the Directors on Crisil Ratings Limited’s Board are members of rating committee and thus do not participate in discussion or assignment of any ratings. The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities Detailed Rationale Crisil Ratings has reaffirmed its ‘Crisil BBB+/Stable/Crisil A2’ ratings on the bank facilities of Menon Bearings Ltd (MBL). The ratings continue to reflect the established market position of the company in the bearings industry marked by strong clientele and longstanding presence, healthy operating margin and strong financial risk profile. These strengths are partially offset by modest scale of operations and revenue concentration in the automotive (auto) sector. Analytical Approach Crisil Ratings has consolidated the business and financial risk profiles of MBL and its subsidiaries, which are strategically important to and have a significant degree of operational integration. Please refer Annexure - List of Entities Consolidated, which captures the list of entities considered and their analytical treatment of consolidation. Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description Strengths: Established market position: Presence of around three decades in the bearings industry has enabled MBL to establish its position across diverse markets and industries. The company earns revenue by catering to original equipment manufacturers and replacement market demand for domestic as well as export markets, which contributed around 25-30% of its revenue. The established market position and superior product quality allows MBL to command higher margins, reflected in operating margin of around 20% for the four fiscals through 2024. Strong clientele: The company has built healthy relationships with key clients, including John Deere, Tata Motors Ltd (‘Crisil AA+/Stable/Crisil A1+’) and International Tractors Ltd and Brakes India Ltd, among others. MBL is either the sole supplier or a major supplier of bearings for most customers. Steady flow of repeat orders resulted in revenue increasing to Rs 212 crore in fiscal 2024, from Rs 149 crore in fiscal 2021. Healthy financial risk profile: The capital structure has been healthy, as reflected in networth of Rs 144.8 crore, gearing of 0.23 time and total outside liabilities to adjusted networth ratio of 0.43 time as on March 31, 2024. Debt protection metrics were strong, as indicated by interest coverage ratio of 13.8 times and net cash accrual to total debt ratio of 0.61 time for fiscal 2024. Despite the debt-funded capital expenditure (capex) towards capacity addition in the bi-metal and alkop divisions to be undertaken in fiscal 2025, the financial risk profile is expected to remain healthy over the medium term with gradual repayment of term loans and healthy accretion to reserve. Weaknesses: Modest, but increasing, scale of operations: Revenue has been modest at Rs 212 crore in fiscal 2024 and Rs 117 crore during the first half of fiscal 2025. Modest scale of operations restricts pricing power with customers and suppliers. With capacity additions in the bi-metal and alkop divisions, revenue is expected to increase yet remain modest. Scale up in operations while sustaining the operating margin will remain a key monitorable. Revenue concentration in the auto industry: Of the total revenue, 80-90% comes from the auto sector and the remaining from the oil and gas, electrical and engineering industries. Within the auto segment, MBL derives bulk of its revenue from the commercial vehicle and tractor segments, which are inherently cyclical. Hence, any sharp reduction in demand from these segments, will adversely impact the credit risk profile of MBL. Liquidity: Adequate Cash accrual is expected at more than Rs 23 crore per annum, after factoring dividend payout, and will comfortably cover yearly term debt obligation of Rs 4.5-7.5 crore over the medium term. Bank limit utilisation was around 65% during the 12 months through December 2024. Cash and equivalents stood at Rs 25.07 crore as of September 2024. Outlook: Stable MBL will continue to benefit from its strong market position and established clientele and sustain its healthy financial risk profile. Rating Sensitivity Factors Upward factors Revenue growth of more than 25% and stable operating margin, leading to higher-than-expected net cash accrual Sustenance of healthy financial risk profile and improvement in the working capital cycle Downward factors Decline in revenue or profitability, resulting in net cash accrual below Rs 15 crore Sizeable stretch in the working capital cycle, or any larger-than-expected, debt-funded capex or acquisition or sizeable dividend payout. About the company Incorporated in 1991 as a part of the Kolhapur (Maharashtra)-based Menon group and promoted by Mr Ram Menon and his family members, MBL manufactures auto components such as bearings, bushes, thrust washers and bi-metal strips at its plant in Kolhapur. It also manufactures aluminum die-cast products. It is listed on Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange of India Ltd.

Details of Facilities/Instruments are in Annexure 1. Facility wise lender details are at
Annexure 2. Detailed explanation of covenants is at Annexure 3.
Detailed Rationale
The reaffirmation of the ratings assigned to the bank facilities of Rushil Decor Limited (RDL)
continue to derive comfort from its long and successful track record under experienced
promoters and management team with its state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, proximity to
raw material sources, diversified product stream with a strong brand name and extensive
distribution network in geographically diversified business operations. Further, the ratings also
consider satisfactory business performance of the company in FY24 [FY refers to the period
from April 1 to March 31] and in Q1FY25 coupled with its improved capital structure and
satisfactory debt protection metrics. These rating strengths are offset by susceptibility of its
operating margin to raw material price fluctuation, exposure to foreign exchange fluctuation
risk, working capital intensive nature of its operations and exposure to intense competition
along with cyclical nature of the wood-panel industry. The ratings also consider the risks
related to ongoing capex. The company is expanding its laminates production capacity by
adding a new facility for jumbo size laminates in Mansa, Gujarat. Timely commissioning of the
plant along with stabilization of operations, without any significant cost overruns, will be a key
monitorable.
1
The stable outlook reflects that the company will maintain a stable operating performance and
ensure adequate cash flow generation from operations to comfortably meet its debt
obligations.
Key Rating Sensitivities:
Upward Factors
• Significant growth in scale of business with improvement in profitability metrics thereby leading
to overall improvement in cash accruals
• Improvement in the capital structure along with improvement in debt service parameters
• Improvement in working capital management
Downward Factors
• Dip in operating income or profitability impacting the debt coverage indicators with moderation
in interest coverage ratio to below 2x
• Significant delay in commissioning of the laminate plant resulting in higher-than-expected time
or cost overrun/ any debt funded large capex leading to deterioration in capital structure with
moderation in overall gearing to above 1.5x
• Elongation in the operating cycle impacting liquidity
List of Key Rating Drivers with Detailed Description
Key Rating Strengths
• Experienced promoters and management team
The promoters of RDL have vast experience in trading, manufacturing, and marketing of
plywood, laminates, and other wood panel products. The founder promoter of the company
Late Mr. Ghanshyam Thakkar had more than three decades of experience in this field. The
operation of the company is currently looked after by Mr. Krupesh Thakkar, Chairman, having
an experience of more than three decades in the wood panel industry. Mr. Rushil Thakkar,
son of Mr. Krupesh Thakkar, is the Managing Director of the company. The promoters are well
supported by a team of experienced professionals, who are at the helm of managing day to
day affairs of the company.
• Long and successful track record
2
The company started with manufacturing of decorative laminates in 1993 and gradually
diversified its product profile. RDL has established itself as a renowned player in Laminates &
allied products. The company forayed into MDF segment in 2012 and within short span of time
became one of the largest MDF players in the country. Presently, within the organised sector,
RDL remains one of the largest manufacturers of MDF boards and decorative laminates in
India.
• State of the art manufacturing facilities with satisfactory capacity utilisation
The manufacturing facilities of RDL are ISO 9001:2000 certified. Moreover, its MDF unit has
a Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and eco-mark certification, and the laminate manufacturing
unit has a Green-label certification from Singapore environmental council. Further, the
facilities of the company are running with healthy capacity utilisation over the years. Better
capacity utilisation resulted in better absorption of fixed overheads and supported the
profitability.
• Proximity to raw material sources
Key raw materials for manufacturing laminate are base paper, kraft paper, phenol,
formaldehyde, melamine, methanol, and other allied chemicals which are locally available
whereas premium quality papers are imported. For manufacturing MDF, raw materials
required are wood, resin and wax which also are easily available in the nearby areas of
Chikmagalur and Visakhapatnam. RDL has established relationship with various nearby
sawmills in the vicinity to reduce dependence on overseas suppliers and reduce the
transportation cost. The proximity to raw material sources imparts advantage to RDL in terms
of cost of raw materials and lower logistics expenditure.
• Diversified product stream with a strong brand name and extensive distribution
network
The company offers a wide range of products in various segments like commercial/industrial
(double- sided), decorative (single-sided) laminate and offers products across different price
points, which enable it to cater to a broader customer base. It markets its products under brand
name of ‘VIR LAMINATES’, ‘SIGNOR’ and ‘VIR MDF’ and has a well-established marketing
and distribution network in domestic as well as international market. However, MDF is a
logistic intensive industry and RDL majorly caters to Southern Indian states like Andhra
Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Kerala through its manufacturing unit located in
Chikmagalur, Karnataka and Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.
3
• Geographically diversified business operations
Exports contributed ~28% to the total sales in FY24. Its major export destinations are Middle
East countries as well as Asian markets.
• Satisfactory business performance in FY24 & in Q1FY25
In FY24, total operating income remained stable at Rs.843.97 crore compared to Rs. 838.40
crore in FY23. Despite increase in sales volume, moderation in average sales realisation
impacted revenue growth. EBITDA margin moderated from 17.82% in FY23 to 14.21% in
FY24 mainly on account of rising raw material cost, specifically the wood cost and higher sales
and marketing expenditure. Consequently, PAT margin and cash accruals have also
moderated. Gross cash accruals decreased from Rs.115.47 crore in FY23 to Rs.78.18 crore
in FY24. In Q1FY25, the company has achieved revenue of ~Rs. 224 crore. However, the
company has witnessed moderation in its EBITDA margin on y-o-y basis in Q1FY25.
• Improvement in capital structure and satisfactory debt protection metrics
The capital structure of the company strengthened following the fund raising of ~Rs. 107 crore
through right issue in May 2023 and share warrant money received of Rs. 48.76 crore till June
2024 (out of total share warrant issue of Rs. 122.66 crore). Tangible Net worth improved to
Rs.518.84 crore as on March 31,2024 from Rs. 339.15 crore as on March 31, 2023. This led
to improvement in long-term debt equity ratio from 0.79x as on March 31, 2023 to 0.41x as on
March 31, 2024 and overall gearing ratio from 1.02x as on March 31, 2023 to 0.57x as on
March 31, 2024. Due to decrease in EBITDA level, interest coverage ratio moderated from
6.35x in FY23 to 3.72x in FY24. Moreover, total indebtedness as indicated by its TOL/ATNW
also improved to 1.07x as on March 31, 2024 compared to 1.64x as on March 31, 2023.
Key Rating Weaknesses
• Susceptibility of operating margin to raw material price fluctuation
Raw material cost formed about 58-62% of the total production cost for RDL during the last
three fiscals. Main raw materials for manufacturing laminate i.e., base paper, kraft paper,
phenol, formaldehyde, melamine, methanol and other allied chemicals are available locally;
however, high-end and premium quality papers are imported. Methanol and Phenol being the
primary chemical requirements, their availability and price has a significant impact on the
operating margins of the company. Being a crude oil derivative the prices of both the products
in international market are highly volatile. On the other hand, major raw materials for
manufacturing MDF are wood, resin and wax. The wood panel-based industries are largely
4
dependent on natural forests (generally eucalyptus, silver, oak, poplar etc) for their raw
material requirements. Any short supply of wood may lead to rise in price of raw materials.
• Exposure to risks related to project commissioning and stabilisation
The company is expanding its laminates production capacity by adding a new facility for jumbo
size sheets (laminates) in Mansa, Gujarat. This facility will add 2.8 million jumbo-size laminate
sheets per year to its existing production capacity. The total project cost for jumbo-size
laminate project is estimated at Rs. 90.00 crore and it will be completed in two phases. Phase
1, costing Rs. 79.00 crore is scheduled for FY24-25, while Phase 2, costing Rs. 11.00 crore
is scheduled for FY25-26. As on Jun 30, 2024, the company has already incurred Rs. 32.78
crore, funded through equity share warrants. Timely commissioning of the plant along with
stabilization of operations, without any significant cost overruns, will be a key monitorable.
• Intense competition and cyclical nature of wood-panel industry
The decorative laminate industry is highly competitive due to presence of many unorganized
players along with large established players. Further, the industry is also exposed to threat
from cheap imports from Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Moreover, the market
is intensively competitive as larger players in the industry are quite aggressive to take part in
the demand.
• Exposure to foreign exchange fluctuation risk
The company enjoys a natural hedging due to its imports and exports. Further, it also has
defined forex hedging policy to minimize the foreign exchange fluctuation risk. As a policy, the
company hedges its foreign exchange exposure through forward contracts, plain vanilla option
and other similar options. However, the timing difference of the exports and imports exposes
the company towards volatile foreign currency movement.
• Working capital intensive nature of operations
High working capital intensity marked by elongated operating cycle is inherent in the laminates
and wood panel industry. The manufacturers need to maintain sufficient stock of various types
of papers, chemicals, wood in raw material inventory. RDL generally maintain inventory of
about 3-4 months to keep adequate stock imported raw materials such as decorative paper
and chemicals which have a lead time ranging from two to six months from the date of
placement of order. On the other hand, the company need to maintain sufficient finished stock
inventory of its wide product array to respond market demands in a time bound manner. RDL
generally allow a credit period of about 1-2 months. However, the company enjoys a credit
5
period of about 2-3 months from its suppliers. Consequently, operating cycle hovered around
59-91 days during the last three fiscals.

The Outlook is Stable. The detailed rating actions are as follows: Details of Instruments Instrument Description Date of Issuance Coupon Rate Maturity Date Size of Issue (million) Rating Assigned along with Outlook/Watch Rating Action Issuer rating - - - - IND AA+/Stable Affirmed Commercial paper - - Up to 365 days INR1,000 IND A1+ Affirmed Commercial paper - - Up to 365 days INR1,000 IND A1+ Assigned Analytical Approach Ind-Ra continues to take a consolidated view of EPL and its subsidiaries while arriving at the ratings, as the subsidiaries are in the same line of business and have strong legal, operational and strategic linkages among them. Detailed Rationale of the Rating Action The ratings reflect the company’s strong position in the global oral care tubes market with a growing market share in the Beauty & Cosmetics (B&C) tube segment and a diversified geographical presence in the domestic and overseas markets. Also, the company draws strength from its strong promoter group - The Blackstone Group's technical expertise in the packaging sector through its portfolio companies that are spread across the globe. The company's financial performance remained strong with an increase in  revenue as well as EBITDA margins at the consolidated level in FY24 and 1HFY25. Furthermore, the company’s credit profile remained strong in FY24 and 1HFY25, along with an adequate liquidity position with a sufficient cushion in its working capital limits. Ind-Ra expects the credit metrics to remain comfortable over FY25-FY26. The ratings, however, remain constrained by the profitability being exposed to vulnerability in raw material prices as well as exchange rate fluctuations, and competitive pressure from unorganised sector players. List of Key Rating Drivers Strengths- Strong promoter group- Well-diversified presence; established market position- Integrated operations- Contracts with cost pass-through provide cash flow visibility- Focus on innovation; strategic partnership with customers- Improved financial performance- Credit metrics remain strong Weaknesses- Profitability vulnerable to volatility in raw material prices- Vulnerability to exchange rate fluctuations and competitive pressure from unorganised sector players Detailed Description of Key Rating Drivers Strong Promoter Group: EPL is backed by a strong promoter group - The Blackstone Group L.P. (Blackstone), through Epsilon Bidco Pte. Ltd. (Epsilon is an affiliate of funds managed or advised by The Blackstone Group), which held a 51.50% stake in EPL as on 30 September 2024 (30 September 2023: 51.52%). Blackstone is a large global alternative asset management company, with assets under management of over USD1.1 trillion as on 30 June  2024 and a track record of around 40 years with over 230 portfolio companies. Ind-Ra believes the presence of Blackstone brings professional as well as technical expertise in the packaging sector through its portfolio companies that are spread across the globe. Ind-Ra expects Blackstone to continue to leverage on EPL’s global leadership position in the oral care segment and accelerate growth in the B&C segment as well as in new geographies. As the sponsor, Blackstone also provides robust financial backing to EPL whenever needed, thereby improving its financial flexibility. Well-diversified Presence; Established Market Position: EPL has a global presence and operates across four geographical segments: i) Africa, the Middle East and South Asia (AMESA; 34% of FY24 revenue, FY23: 35%), ii) East Asia Pacific (EAP; 22% of FY24 revenue, FY23: 22%), iii) the Americas (23% of FY24 revenue, FY23: 22%), and iv) Europe (21% of FY24 revenue, FY23: 21%). The company has an established position in the global oral care tubes market, and as per the management, it commanded more than a third of the global market share at end-June 2024. The oral care segment accounted for 53% of the company’s revenue in FY24 (FY23: 53%, FY22: 54%). EPL also caters to the personal care or B&C segment, which includes pharmaceutical, beauty and healthcare products, and food industries. As the personal care segment earns higher EBITDA margins than the oral care segment, the company has been focusing on increasing the former’s revenue share. Integrated Operations: EPL manufactures plastic laminate sheets at its plants in India and China, and supplies them to the other plants, which convert these sheets into tubes as per the client’s requirements. This is followed by the printing and capping of the tubes before they are sold to customers. EPL is increasing the in-house manufacturing capabilities for caps and closures, which provides further integration to the operations. The company sells around 9 billion tubes annually. Contracts with Cost Pass-Through Provide Cash Flow Visibility: The company derived about half of its consolidated revenue from its contracted customers in FY24, with a tenor ranging around three years. These contracts allow for a pass-through of raw-material costs, albeit with a lag of three-to-four months. The company also started incorporating a pass through of increase in freight costs in the contracts for the past one year. In addition, EPL negotiates for higher prices with its non-contracted customers based on the raw material prices and other overhead costs. Consequently, the company benefits from long-term revenue and cash-flow visibility, along with relatively lower volatility of margins, despite the sharp fluctuations in raw material, freight, packaging and other costs. The long-term cash flow visibility is further supported by the fact that many of the contracted customers are large and well-reputed multi-national companies. This further allows EPL to effectively manage its capex cycle. Focus on Innovation; Strategic Partnership with Customers: EPL has been spending on research and development (FY23: INR157 million, FY22: INR171 million, FY21: INR212 million) and has been working closely with customers to identify their requirements. During FY24, 27 patents were granted to the company in various countries, including four in India, the applications for registration of which were filed by EPL during the previous financial years. Furthermore, the company’s sustainable tube mix reached 29% in 1QFY25 versus 21% in FY24, which led to a wallet share gain in the oral category during 1QFY25 for the company. Ind-Ra believes EPL’s focus on product and process innovation to develop sustainable packaging solutions across product categories would bolster its customers’ efforts to reach out to environmentally-responsible end-users. The agency believes these innovative and sustainable offerings will help EPL develop strategic ties with suppliers and key customers, enabling it to become an integral part of its value chain. The agency is also of the view these offerings would strengthen EPL’s long-term customer relationships and provide new business opportunities, thereby giving it a sustainability-led competitive advantage. Improved Financial Performance: Despite the challenging external environment with various geopolitical tensions, volatile commodity prices due to supply chain disruptions, Ukraine-Iran conflict and high freight rates  due to disruptions in the Red Sea during the year, EPL’s consolidated revenue grew to INR39,161 million in FY24 (FY23: INR36,941 million, FY22: INR34,328 million), driven by growth across all the geographies - AMESA (FY24: 3.6% yoy), the US (FY24: 12.9%), Europe (5.8% yoy) and EAP (10.1%). EPL’s consolidated EBITDA margin improved to 18.2% (FY23: 14.3%, FY22: 15.6%), due to a recovery in margins seen across various regions. Despite the increased freight costs in 3QFY24, the company reported healthy margins across geographies. The operations of the new greenfield plant in Brazil which became started during FY24, have successfully stabilised during the year, thereby strengthening the company’s presence in the Latin American market. As per the management, the company has a headroom for growth at this plant which can lead to an improvement in the revenue and EBITDA for this region. The company reported certain exceptional items amounting to INR616 million in FY24 owing to foreign exchange loss in the Egypt region of INR465 million, the restructuring of operations in European region of INR140 million and exceptional loss reported for its Columbia subsidiary of INR 11 million, which led to a slight moderation in the profit after tax to INR2,101 million in FY24 (FY23: INR2,307). Furthermore, the company's consolidated revenue stood at INR20,936 million in 1HFY25 with an EBITDA margin of 19.4% and an interest coverage of 6.9x. Credit Metrics Remain Strong: Although the absolute EBITDA improved to INR7,143 million (FY23: INR5,273 million), the company’s interest expense increased 97% yoy during the year on account of an increase in the benchmark interest rates in the Americas and Europe regions, coupled with increased interest for debt availed for the Brazil capex. The consolidated interest coverage (EBITDA/gross interest expense) declined to 6.18x in FY24 (FY23: 9.00x). Nevertheless, the consolidated net leverage (adjusted net debt/operating EBITDA) improved to 0.99x in FY24 (FY23: 1.20x). The consolidated interest coverage was 6.99x and net leverage was 0.86x in 1HFY25. Ind-Ra expects the credit metrics to remain strong in FY25 and over the medium term owing to an improvement in the operating profitability and the company’s prudent debt-led capex policy. Profitability Vulnerable to Volatility in Raw Material Prices: The company’s profitability remains susceptible to adverse movements in raw material prices, one of the main components of the cost structure. The raw material prices are vulnerable to volatility in crude oil prices as well as its demand-supply scenario. The demand-supply dynamics remain the primary driver of EPL's profitability; however, this volatility is partially mitigated as the fluctuations in its input prices are passed on to customers through cost escalation pass-through clauses with customers, although with a lag. Vulnerability to Exchange Rate Fluctuations and Competitive Pressure from Unorganised Sector Players: EPL continues to face competition from unorganised players due to the low entry barriers in the industry. Also, the company remains susceptible to demand slowdown in the regions where it operates. However, EPL’s long-standing customer relationships and its focus on innovation to cater to customer needs, mitigate the competition risk to a large extent. An unprecedented volatility in raw material prices (crude derivatives) is another risk that the company has been managing effectively through pass-through clauses in its contracts, albeit with a lag. Given its global footprint, EPL is also exposed to foreign exchange fluctuation risks. However, this too is being managed effectively through the incorporation of the necessary clauses in the pricing contracts, use of forex risk mitigation measures such as forward contracts, and the presence of a natural hedge from the overseas transactions. Liquidity Adequate: For the 15 months ended September 2024, EPL’s average utilisation of the fund-based limits (including CP) was around 34%. The company had cash and equivalents of about INR2,058 million at FYE24 (FYE23: INR2,573 million), while the undrawn portion of working capital limit stood at around INR2,500 million. Ind-Ra-calculated cash flow from operations (CFO) increased substantially to INR5,877 million in FY24 (FY23: INR5,030 million, FY22: INR2,495 million), on account of an improvement in the EBITDA levels and stable significant working capital outflows. Also, free cash flow (FCF) turned positive at INR735 million in FY24 (FY23: negative INR251 million). The return on capital employed also improved to 14.7% in FY24 (FY23: 13.2%; FY22: 15.0%; as reported by the company), in line with the higher profitability despite higher outstanding debt. Ind-Ra expects the FCF to remain positive in the near term, on account of company’s prudent debt-led capex policy. The scheduled term loan repayment was INR1,449 million and INR1,280 million for FY25  and FY26, respectively. As per the management, the CPs are carved out from working capital limits. Rating Sensitivities Positive: A significant improvement in the scale of profitability, improved revenue diversification while maintaining liquidity with the net leverage remaining below 1.0x could lead to a positive rating action. Negative: Deterioration in the operating profitability and/or increase in working capital intensity; and/or any large unplanned capex outflow; and/or any higher-than-Ind-Ra-expected payout to shareholders leading to the net leverage exceeding 2.5x, all on a sustained basis, could lead to a negative rating action. A substantial decline in the return on capital employed and cash flow from operations on a sustained basis could also lead to a negative rating action. Any Other Information Standalone Profile: On a standalone basis, EPL’s revenue grew 6% yoy to INR12,805 million in FY24 (FY23:  INR12,086 million, FY22: INR10,853 million), with an improvement in its EBITDA margin to 19.3% (17.3%, 15.8%). The interest expense remained broadly stable at around INR 217 million in FY24 (FY23: 222 million). The interest coverage also improved to 11.38x in FY24 (9.4x in FY23, FY22: 11.8x). Furthermore, the net leverage improved to 0.8x in FY24 (FY23: 0.9x, FY322: 1.4x), on account of a wider EBITDA base (FY24: INR2,470 million, FY23: INR2,091 million, FY22: INR1,885 million) despite an increase in the net debt (INR1,958 million, INR1,8233 million) owing to a slight increase in the working capital borrowings. The company earned a standalone revenue of INR6,87 million in 1HFY25 with an EBITDA margin of 17.9% and interest coverage of 11.59x.

the other hand, the inventory days of the company stood at 38 days as on 31st March 2024 against 50 days as on
31st March 2023.
Highly fragmented and competitive industry
In paper division- The Company is operating in highly competitive and fragmented industry. It is exposed to intense
competition from several players operating in the industry. The kraft paper manufacturers in India are exposed to
the risk of volatility in waste paper prices, largely due to intense competition. On account of competitive
pressures, players face challenges in passing on increased costs to end users. Business risk profile will remain
constrained by exposure to the downturn in the paper industry. The rise in the prices of duplex paper over that of
waste paper is expected to be gradual, rendering the profitability susceptible to volatility in the price of paper.
Furthermore, any abrupt change in raw material prices due to supply-demand scenario can lead to distortion of
prices and affect the profitability of the company.
In hotel division- The hospitality sector is vulnerable to downturns in both the domestic and global economy. It is
also sensitive to high competition and cyclicality. In a downturn, premium hotels are more negatively impacted
because, despite high operating costs, their revenue per available room falls more precipitously than that of mid-
sized or budget hotels. As a result, the cash flow from premium properties is more vulnerable to economic
downturns. Also, the Indian hotel business is seeing fierce rivalry as a result of the expansion of domestic players
and the growing presence of overseas competitors.

categories is based on factors like variability of the returns to the investors, uncertainty in cash flow patterns,
number of counterparties and general understanding of the instrument by the market. It has to be understood that
complexity is different from credit risk and even an instrument categorized as 'Simple' can carry high levels of
risk. For more details, please refer Rating Criteria “Complexity Level Of Financial Instruments” on www.acuite.in.

The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities Detailed Rationale Crisil Ratings has reaffirmed its ‘Crisil AA/Stable/Crisil A1+’ ratings on the long-term bank facilities and debt instruments of PVR INOX Limited (PVR). Crisil Ratings has also withdrawn its rating on NCDs worth Rs 50 crore and the long-term principal-protected market-linked debentures worth Rs 100 crore, as requested by the client, and in line with the policy of withdrawal. The reaffirmation factors the expectation that operating margins will rebound and sustain at above 11%, over the medium term, resulting in improvement in return on capital employed (ROCE) over 11-13% for fiscal 2026. The improvement is expected on the back of stronger content pipeline and steps taken by company for improving operating efficiency such as re-releases, alternate content screening, live sports screening, passport programme, etc. and focus on optimising the operating cost. The company fared lower occupancy of 23.9% during the first nine months of fiscal 2025, as against 26.6% in fiscal 2024, due to the lingering impact of the 2023 Hollywood strike, postponement in release of certain Hindi titles, and gap in the release calendar. This led to operating margins of 9.8% for the first nine months of fiscal 2025. Delay in ramp up will be a key rating sensitivity factor. The reaffirmation also factors that company would continue a deleveraging path. Net debt has reduced to Rs 996 crore as on December 31, 2024, from Rs 1,294 crore as on March 31, 2024, and may decline further to less than Rs 800 core by fiscal 2026, to balance variability in operating performance. The reaffirmation also reflects the strong market position with an established brand, expectation of improvement in operating efficiency, led by synergistic benefits and premiumisation, and the above-average financial risk profile. These strengths are partially offset by exposure to content risks inherent in the film exhibition business and rising competition from alternate media and broadcasting mediums. Analytical Approach Crisil Ratings has combined the business and financial risk profiles of PVR; its subsidiaries, PVR Pictures Ltd, PVR Lanka Ltd and Zea Maize Pvt Ltd. The entities, collectively referred to as PVR, are engaged in the same business, under common promoters. Please refer Annexure - List of Entities Consolidated, which captures the list of entities considered and their analytical treatment of consolidation. Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description Strengths: Strong market position with an established brand: PVR is the largest multiplex player in India, with 1,745 screens across 111 cities as on December 31, 2024. The second largest player in this segment is one-fourth the size of PVR. The merged entity has a geographically diversified screen portfolio across India. Going forward, the company will continue to benefit from its strong and established market position, via optimisation of the screen portfolio and better pricing power with stakeholders. Improving operating efficiency, aided by benefits of synergy and scale: Operating metrics will continue to improve, aided by synergy benefits, post-merger with INOX in January 2023, and increase in scale in the film exhibition business. This includes continued optimisation of operational parameters such as reduction of operating cost per screen and renegotiation of rental agreements. The company is actively reducing upfront capital expenditure (capex) by transitioning to new capital-efficient growth models such as FOCO (franchise-owned and company-operated – 100% investment by the developer) and asset-light (40-80% investment by the developer). Gross addition of 100-120 screens annually would be mostly undertaken through the new model. The company is likely to incur overall capex, including addition of new screens, maintenance of existing ones, and IT-driven initiatives, of Rs 400-500 crore for fiscal 2026 Above-average financial risk profile expected to improve further over the medium term: Financial risk profile is characterised by reduction in net debt from Rs 1,294 crore as on March 31, 2024, to Rs 996 crore as December 31, 2024. Further, Crisil Ratings expects that net debt will continue a reducing trajectory going forward. Ebitda (excluding other income) has reduced to Rs 386 crore in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 and Rs 387 crore for calendar 2024, compared to Rs 712 crore in fiscal 2024, largely due to tepid performance of film content. Going forward, Ebitda (excluding other income) should improve, aided by a stronger content pipeline and steps taken by the company to strengthen the operating efficiency. Weaknesses: Exposure to risks inherent in the film exhibition business: The film exhibition business remains inherently susceptible to fluctuations in profitability, due to variability in performance of content. Such fluctuations impact multiplex players, given their high fixed cost, and high dependence on occupancy, which is driven by success of films. Extent of fluctuation in operating margin has increased post pandemic, vis-à-vis pre-pandemic, when even films with poor reviews delivered an average box office collection, supporting occupancy. The harsher impact of weak content on occupancy post-pandemic has made the film exhibition business much riskier. Rising competition from alternative media and broadcasting mediums: Other forms of entertainment and new content distribution platforms, including over-the-top, have emerged as competitors for content distribution, especially for small- and medium-budget movies and longer form content. This trend will pose challenges in sustaining profitability and growth for PVR. Hence, material changes to consumption patterns from current levels by audiences over longer term will be monitorable. Liquidity: Strong Cash and cash equivalents were around Rs 664 crore as on December 31, 2024. Cash accrual is expected to be healthy over Rs 500 crore for fiscal 2025, against term debt obligation of Rs 420 crore. Commercial paper of Rs 150 crore will be due for redemption in fiscal 2026. Fund-based limit of around Rs 247 crore remained unutilised  as on December 31, 2024. Capex plans will be funded prudently via debt and internal accrual such that debt does not increase materially. Outlook: Stable Crisil Ratings believes PVR will continue to benefit from its established market position and brand equity, while the financial risk profile should remain supported by healthy cash accrual. Rating sensitivity factors Upward factors Sustained increase in occupancy levels, leading to higher revenue and sustenance of operating margin above 18% and RoCE at 30% Sustained improvement in the financial risk profile Downward factors Delayed traction in improvement of occupancy, with profitability and / or ROCE remaining lower than 11% and 12% respectively Delayed deleveraging than expected Environment, social and governance (ESG) profile Crisil Ratings believes the ESG profile of PVR supports its strong credit risk profile. The media and entertainment sector has a low impact on the environment because of low greenhouse gas emissions in core operations and lower generation of hazardous waste. The sector has a social impact because of its large workforce. PVR has continuously focused on mitigating its environmental and social impact. Highlights: The company has been investing in rooftop solar photovoltaic grid, which is under implementation in 15 locations. As part of its corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, PVR is constantly working in areas such as climate change and health and safety for women and children. The board of directors comprises 50% independent directors with a split in positions of chairman and chief executive officer, a healthy investor grievance redressal mechanism and extensive disclosures. There is growing importance of ESG among investors and lenders. PVR’s commitment to ESG principles will play a key role in enhancing stakeholder confidence, given the high shareholding of foreign portfolio investors in the company. About the Company PVR was established in 1995 as a 60:40 JV between Priya Exhibitors Pvt Ltd and Village Roadshow Ltd (VRL), a world leader in the multiplex business. In 1995, PVR took a single-screen cinema hall, Anupam, in Saket, Delhi, on lease and converted it into a four-screen multiplex, which started operations in 1997 as PVR Anupam, and was the first multiscreen cineplex in India. As part of its global business strategy, VRL exited the JV in 2002. In November 2012, PVR acquired Cinemax, strengthening its presence in west India. Cinemax operated in 39 locations with 138 screens. This acquisition made PVR the largest multiplex operator in India. In May 2016, it completed the acquisition of 32 screens (29 operational and 3 upcoming) from DT Cinemas for Rs 433 crore. In January 2017, Warburg Pincus LLC acquired a 14% stake in PVR—9% from current shareholders (Multiples Private Equity Fund I Ltd) and 5% from the promoters. In August 2018, PVR acquired SPI Cinemas, adding 76 screens to its portfolio. In January 2023, the Mumbai Bench of the National Company Law Tribunal approved the proposed scheme of amalgamation of INOX with PVR, and the merger became effective as on February 6, 2023.

Rating Rationale Rating Rationale May 05, 2025 | Mumbai Dmcc Speciality Chemicals LimitedRating reaffirmed at 'Crisil BBB+/Stable'; Rated amount enhanced for Bank Debt Rating ActionTotal Bank Loan Facilities RatedRs.130.96 Crore (Enhanced from Rs.125 Crore)Long Term RatingCrisil BBB+/Stable (Reaffirmed) Rs.20 Crore Fixed DepositsCrisil BBB+/Stable (Reaffirmed)Note: None of the Directors on Crisil Ratings Limited’s Board are members of rating committee and thus do not participate in discussion or assignment of any ratings. The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities Detailed Rationale Crisil Ratings has reaffirmed its 'Crisil BBB+/Stable' rating on the bank loan facilities and fixed deposits of Dmcc Speciality Chemicals Limited (Formerly known as The Dharamsi Morarji Chemical Company Limited) (DMCC). The ratings continue to reflect DMCC's established market position in the chemical industry and an above-average financial risk profile. These strengths are partially offset by exposure to volatile end products and raw material prices and regulatory risks. Analytical Approach Crisil Ratings has evaluated the standalone business and financial risk profiles of DMCC Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description Strengths: Extensive experience of the promoters, large portfolio of bulk and specialty chemicals: The three-decade-long experience of the promoters, their strong understanding of market dynamics and established relationships with customers and suppliers will continue to support the business. Mr. Bimal Goculdas, CEO & Managing Director from Promoter Group, is involved in daily operations. The company has built a large portfolio over a period and presently has nearly 4 key products offering in the bulk chemical segment and 8 key products offering in the specialty chemical segment.  During 9MFY25, revenue grew by 26% to Rs 306 crore against Rs 243 crore during 9MFY24. The company estimated to achieve revenue of Rs.400-410 Crores in FY 25. Adequate financial risk profile: Networth was healthy at Rs 192 crore as on September 30, 2025. Gearing stood at 0.28 times as on September 30, 2025, which was reduced from 0.35 times as of September 30, 2024. Debt protection metrics were healthy, as reflected in interest coverage and net cash accrual to total debt ratios of 4.27 times and 0.26 times, respectively, in H1FY25. Financial risk profile is expected to remain healthy over the medium term. Improvement in debt protection metrics was driven by better operating margin during the period with limited reliance on external debt. Weaknesses: Vulnerability to risks inherent in the commodity chemicals and raw material prices: Profitability is susceptible to price fluctuations in raw material as well as end products. Major raw materials are sulfur, benzene, ethanol, and boron, etc. and raw material cost account for about 60-65% of total sales. Any adverse fluctuation in raw material prices can impact profitability. Further, in bulk chemicals competition is high and the ability to pass on price fluctuations is limited. This is reflected in the volatile operating margin of 8.8-17.72 (8.8% in fiscal 2023) over the four years through fiscal 2024. During 9MFY25, the Company achieved EBIDTA of 13.69% due to higher realization from Boron products. Going forward company expected to have operating profitability in the range of 13% to 14% over medium term. Overall movement in operating margin will be key monitorable. Exposure to regulatory risks: Company is into manufacturing chemicals from sulfur and ethanol chemistry; due to its hazardous nature, it is exposed to regulatory risks. Liquidity: Adequate Bank limit utilization is low at around 39 percent for the past twelve months ended December 2024. Net cash accruals are expected to be over Rs 35 crore which are sufficient against term debt obligation of Rs 20-24 crore over the medium term. In addition, it will act as cushion to the liquidity of the company. Outlook: Stable Crisil Ratings believes that DMCC will continue to benefit from its established market position, enhanced capacities and comfortable financial risk profile Rating sensitivity factors Upward factors: Sizable increase in scale of operations while maintaining operating margin above 15% leading to higher cash accrual Sustenance of comfortable financial risk profile with prudent working capital management Downward factors: Decline in revenue and operating margin remaining below 10% leading to lower cash accrual Large capex or stretched working capital cycle weakening the financial risk profile About the Group Incorporated in 1919, DMCC primarily manufactures commodity and specialty chemicals, with plants in Roha (Maharashtra) and Dahej (Gujarat). Borax Morarji Ltd, a group company, was amalgamated with DMCC with effect from April 01, 2016. DMCC is listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange. DMCC was earlier engaged into manufacturing of phosphate fertilizers, such as single super phosphate, under its well-known ‘Ship’ brand. The company has discontinued fertilizer manufacturing since 2007.

*Instrument details are provided in Annexure-I
Rationale
The revision in the outlook of Ramco Systems Limited (RSL/ the company) considers the expected improvement in the
company’s revenues and earnings on the back of its healthy order book, better project execution and cost optimisation
measures adopted by the company. RSL's revenue for FY2024 increased 7% year-on-year (YoY), driven by new orders in
the aviation sector. However, a sharp increase in provisioning (Rs. 128.9 crore in FY2024) towards trade receivables and
unbilled revenues resulted in operating losses in FY2024. Nonetheless, after a high one-time provisioning of Rs. 107.2 crore in
Q2 FY2024, provisioning levels have declined sharply in the past three quarters and are expected to remain low going forward.
Additionally, RSL’s revenues are likely to improve in FY2025 owing to the company’s healthy order book position. Its operating
margin is expected to improve on the back of increased scale, rationalisation of employee costs and lower provisioning,
although its ability to achieve positive net profits remains to be seen. The company’s debt profile includes Rs. 62.7 crore of
lease liabilities and no other external borrowings as of March 31, 2024, while its liquidity is adequate, supported by a healthy
buffer in working capital limits and Rs. 49.7 crore in cash and liquid investments as on June 30, 2024.
The ratings consider RSL’s extensive track record and its established presence in the enterprise resource planning (ERP)
business, along with its long-term association with its client base of leading global companies across diversified verticals. The
company’s ratings also factor in its strong financial flexibility, stemming from being a part of the Ramco Group. Equity infusion
of Rs. 160.0 crore in the past 20 months has supported the company’s capitalisation metrics and liquidity position.
However, the ratings are constrained by the inherent need for continuous investments towards R&D, intense competition in
the industry accentuating risk of employee attrition, its working capital-intensive nature of operations and its vulnerability to
changes in domestic and foreign government policies affecting the IT industry at large. Additionally, the company’s earnings
remain susceptible to exchange rate volatility.
Key rating drivers and their description
Credit strengths
Extensive track record of nearly three decades and established presence in the ERP segment – Incorporated in 1997, RSL
offers customised global payroll, logistics, SRP, and EAM services for various industries. It has developed considerable expertise
in catering to the aviation sector and has also forayed into the US defence sector. Additionally, the company’s shift towards a
www.icra .in 1
Page |
subscription-based business model from a deferred licensing model has led to better cashflow generation and a reduction in
unbilled revenues.
Diversified customer base of reputed companies – The company has an established clientele of reputed companies, including
Fortune 500 companies from diverse sectors. RSL enjoys high customer diversification (as the top 10 clients accounted for 19%
of its revenues in FY2024) with repeat orders from large clients, including industry majors, even as it continues to add a healthy
number of new customers every year. RSL added 25 new clients in FY2024, with 8% of the overall revenues accruing from its
new customers. ICRA expects the company to consistently add new clients on the back of its extensive track record of
operations and niche product offerings in the aviation sector.
Financial flexibility as part of the Ramco Group – The Ramco Group of companies has diversified interests in cement, cotton,
synthetic yarn, building products, software solutions, clean energy, and biotechnology, among other sectors. RSL derives
financial flexibility by being part of the Ramco Group. ICRA notes that the equity infusion of Rs. 160.0 crore in the past 20
months has supported the company’s capitalisation metrics and liquidity position.
Comfortable capital structure – RSL’s debt profile includes Rs. 62.7 crore of lease liabilities and no other external borrowings
as on March 31, 2024. The company has raised funds to the tune of Rs. 160.0 crore over the last 20 months (from which Rs.
30.0 crore equity has been infused in July 2024), which shored up the net worth base against losses. Accordingly, the capital
structure remained healthy, marked by gearing of 0.2 times and TOL/TNW of 1.0 times as on March 31, 2024. While the
working capital debt is likely to increase marginally in the near term, capital structure is expected to remain comfortable going
forward.
Credit challenges
Net losses amid higher fixed costs; sharp improvement in scale and margins remains critical – In FY2024, the company
reported an operating income of Rs. 527.3 crore (7% YoY growth) with a net loss of Rs. 241.7 crore. RSL conducted a strategic
review of its operations, considering various factors such as project viability, recoverability of old receivables, identification
and exiting unprofitable segments, renewed focus on customer profiling and country-specific risks. Based on this review, it
made a provision of Rs. 128.9 crore in FY2024. Receivable days, which were high earlier at 261 days as on March 31, 2023
owing to sizeable unbilled revenues, declined to 85 days post the provisioning of FY2024. This, coupled with a slower-than-
expected rebound in revenues, resulted in sharp losses for the fiscal. In Q1 FY2025, the company achieved revenues of Rs.
137.0 crore (4.4% QoQ growth), while the margin improved to 2.5% on account of reduced forex fluctuation losses and the
company’s continuous cost optimisation measures. ICRA expects RSL’s revenues and operating margins to improve in FY2025
owing to its healthy order book. However, due to the company’s high fixed costs, it is expected to continue incurring net losses
in the current fiscal. Further, the company’s ability to secure more deals and manage implementation risks remains a key
monitorable.
High competitive intensity; vulnerable to industry risks such as employee attrition and adverse changes in Government
policies – RSL faces intense competition from large established players, which limits its pricing flexibility and puts pressure on
its margins. The company is also exposed to broader IT industry risks such as global demand slowdown, high employee attrition
and adverse changes in foreign and domestic Government policies among other factors.
Exposure to forex risk – RSL’s profit margins are susceptible to volatility in forex rates and have been impacted by forex gain/
(loss) arising from the same in the past. Some of the losses are mark-to-market provisions, which might be reversed
subsequently. The company usually tries to mitigate the risk to an extent by timing the receivables from its subsidiaries and
repaying the outstanding packing credit (foreign currency) debt using export proceeds in foreign currency.

Environment and Social Risks
Environmental considerations: The exposure to environmental risks remains low for the IT industry. For industry participants,
the primary environmental impact arises from their use of electricity to power systems and use of water resources. RSL has
been undertaking initiatives, which are expected to have environmental benefits and improve sustainability of the
organisation. Some of them include the reduction of carbon footprint by replacing old generators, air conditioners, lifts, and
conventional lights with the latest energy efficient equipment; replacing conventional lights across offices with LED lights; and
replacing old sanitary fittings with the latest water conserving fittings and sensor taps.
Social considerations: The exposure to social risks is moderate for the IT sector. Given that a sizeable part of the revenue is
generated from overseas/international clients and employees are deployed across multiple geographies, RSL remains exposed
to various social risks, such as changes in immigration laws and cybersecurity threats. This situation could result in increased
employee and administration costs to the company. RSL enhances its cybersecurity by adopting frameworks covering endpoint
detection and response (EDR), data level protection (DLP), privileged access management (PAM), zero trust network (ZTN),
data encryption at rest and in transit. Data and processes are monitored through security information and event management
systems (SIEM) with a robust security governance structure. All these supplement the company’s existing information security
management system (ISMS) and SOC2 Type II controls. RSL’s systems are regularly audited every year by third-party agencies
to ensure information security for the services offered through SaaS. The profitability of industry participants, including RSL,
remains vulnerable to increase in wage costs. The company has instituted various employee stock option plans (ESOPs) to
increase employee commitment and engagement.
Liquidity position: Adequate
RSL’s liquidity is adequate, with a buffer in working capital limits (against drawing power) of ~Rs. 44.0 crore, and cash and
liquid balances, amounting to Rs. 49.7 crore as on June 30, 2024. The company does not have any term debt repayment
obligations, however, it will continue to spend on R&D in FY2025. Additionally, the promoter, Mr. Venkatrama Raja, has infused
Rs. 30.0 crore by exercising warrants in July 2024. The company enjoys healthy financial flexibility as part of the Ramco Group,
with a demonstrated track record of financial support.
Rating sensitivities
Positive factors - The ratings could be upgraded if there is material improvement in its revenues, earnings and cash flows
from operations on the back of timely implementation of projects and healthy order bookings.
Negative factors - The ratings could be downgraded if there is sustained deterioration in the company’s earnings and cash
flows, weakening its liquidity profile. Any large debt-funded capex in the absence of meaningful improvement in cash
accruals could also be a negative rating trigger.

Rating Rationale
Acuité has reaffirmed the long-term rating of ‘ACUITE D’ (read as ACUITE D) and short-
term rating of ‘ACUITE D’ (read as ACUITE D) on the Rs. 68.20 crore bank facilities of
Gyscoal Alloys Limited (GAL). The rating continues to be flagged as “Issuer Not-Cooperating”
and is based on the best available information.
About the Company
GAL, incorporated in 1999, is a Gujarat based company promoted by Mr. Viral Shah. The
company is engaged in the manufacture of alloy ingots, billets and stainless steel long
products.
Non-cooperation by the issuer/borrower:
Acuité has been requesting for data, information and undertakings from the rated entity for
conducting surveillance & review of the rating. However, the issuer/borrower failed to submit
such information before the due date.
This rating is, therefore, being flagged as “Issuer not-cooperating”, in line with prevailing SEBI
regulations and Acuité’s policies.
Limitation regarding information availability:
The rating is based on information available from sources other than the issuer/borrower (in
the absence of information provided by the issuer/borrower). Acuité endeavored to gather
information about the entity/industry from the public domain. Therefore, Acuité cautions
lenders and investors regarding the use of such information, on which the indicative credit
rating is based.

(₹ crore)
Long Term Bank Facilities 58.00 CARE BB+; Stable Assigned
Long Term / Short Term Bank Facilities 183.00 CARE BB+; Stable / CARE A4+ Assigned
Details of instruments/facilities in Annexure-1.
Rationale and key rating drivers
The ratings assigned to the bank facilities of Megastar Foods Limited (MFL) are constrained by the modest scale of operations of
the company with low profitability margins. The ratings also factor in competition from organized and unorganized players along
with market dynamics to impact raw material availability and its pricing. The ratings also take into consideration the working
capital intensive of the operations coupled with high debt repayments during FY25 (refers to the period April 01 to March 31).
However, the ratings derive comfort from long-standing association with reputed clientele, comfortable financial risk profile and
experienced Management and longstanding operations.
Rating sensitivities: Factors likely to lead to rating actions
Positive factors
• Significant increase in scale of operations with total operating income (TOI) increasing above ₹400 crore along with
sustenance of profit before interest, lease rentals, depreciation and taxation (PBILDT) margin above 8%.
• Improvement in debt coverage metrics with interest coverage ratio (ICR) of above 4.00x and Total Debt/PBILDT below 3.00x.
Negative factors
• Deterioration in the financial indicators with an overall gearing of above 2.00x and ICR of less than 2.00x.
• Moderation in PBILDT margin below 4.80% with decline in TOI below ₹230 crore on sustained basis.
Analytical approach: Standalone
Outlook: Stable
“Stable” outlook reflects CARE Rating Limited (CARE Ratings) opinion that MFL will continue to derive benefit from its long-
standing experience of promoters in the industry.
Detailed description of key rating drivers:
Key weaknesses
Moderation in operational performance
The operational performance of the company moderated slightly by ~5% to ₹254.06 crore in FY24 owing to stock limits imposed
on wheat during H1FY24 (refers to the period from April 01 to September 31). The profitability margins as reflected by PBILDT
and PAT margin also remained low 5% and 2.43%, respectively, in FY24, from 7.74% and 6.39%, respectively, in FY23 as the
company procured the raw materials high prices. However, the operational performance of the company has shown an increasing
trend over the years. Furthermore, it is expected to improve in H2FY25 (refers to the period from October 01 to March 31) as
reflected by TOI of ₹144.59 crore during H1FY25. The company has also enhanced its production capacity, which is expected to
support the growth in scale of operations of the company over the medium term.
Working capital intensive nature of operations
MFL operating cycle moderated to 62 days as on March 31, 2024, as against 59 days as on March 31, 2023. The high operating
cycle of the company is mainly attributable to inventory levels as the agricultural industry has to maintain stock levels according
to the government policies (stock limit, pricing, etc.). Further, the inventory levels of the company are expected to stay elevated
as on balance sheet date. However, the company’s ability to maintain its operating cycle will remain a key credit monitorable.

Press Release
Competition from organized and unorganized players
The wheat market faces competition from both organized and unorganized players. Major corporations dominate the organized
sector with advanced milling technology and extensive distribution networks. On the other hand, numerous regional mills cater
to local markets, often focusing on traditional milling practices or specific varieties of wheat. This diverse landscape ensures a
dynamic and competitive market environment. The company’s ability to safeguard its profitability margins while managing its
competition in an efficient manner will continue to be a crucial factor to monitor.
Market dynamics to impact raw material availability and pricing
Fluctuations in raw materials, particularly wheat, are often influenced by various factors such as weather conditions, which can
significantly impact both supply and pricing. These disruptions can have a cascading effect on the entire production process,
making it difficult for producers to plan and manage their operations effectively. Further, changes in government policies to have
a direct impact on operational performance, as witnessed in FY24. Overall, the variability in wheat production and supply chain
disruptions underscore the importance of developing resilient agricultural practices and supply chain strategies to mitigate these
risks and ensure a stable supply of wheat. However, MFL, located in Punjab, benefits from the region’s surplus wheat production,
minimizing the impact of raw material availability due to its location. Furthermore, wheat being a commodity exposes the company
to raw material price fluctuations risk. Any major fluctuations in the pricing of wheat, thereby impacting the profitability margins
of MFL will remain a key monitorable.
Project stabilization and offtake risk for recently concluded capex
The company has recently concluded its capacity expansion of 360 MT (metric tonnes), totaling 710 MT, represents expansion in
Milling with a total project cost of ₹109 crore. The company has availed a term loan of ₹59.66 crore along with preference
allotment of ₹42 crore and the remaining ₹14.84 crore from internal accruals. The project implementation started in FY23 and
concluded in the first half of November 2024 which was subsequently operational for production. The company achieving optimum
production with offtake of the enhanced capacity will remain a key monitorable in near future.
Key strengths
Long-standing association with reputed clientele albeit customer concentration risk
Over the years, the company has established a strong relationship with its clients, which is also reflected by repeated sales to
them. However, the top 5 customers account for more than 70% of the total sales over the years, thereby exposing the company
to customer concentration risk.
Comfortable financial risk profile
The overall gearing of the company improved to 0.62x as on March 31, 2024, from 1.27x as on March 31, 2023, owing to
improvement in net-worth of the company. The issuer has sufficient gearing headroom to raise additional debt and equity for its
Capacity expansion plans. However, the debt coverage indicators as reflected by Total debt to gross cash accruals and ICR
moderated to 6.42x and 2.38x, respectively, as on March 31, 2024, as against 4.79x and 3.07x, respectively, as on March 31,
2023. The moderation in debt coverage indicators was primarily due to moderation in operational performance. CARE Ratings
expects slight moderation in the capital structure of the company over the short to medium term owing to additional debt availed
for capacity expansion and expected increase in working capital requirements of the company to support its growing scale of
operations which will be partly funded using bank borrowings.
Experienced Management and longstanding operations
MFL has established a long and successful track record of operations in the food industry. Over the years, the company has grown
by leveraging its extensive experience and understanding of market dynamics. Vikas Goel, Chairman and Managing Director, has
over 30 years of industry experience and plays a crucial role in formulating and implementing business strategies, overseeing the
company’s expansion and overall management. Vikas Gupta, Managing Director, with over 20 years of experience, holds a
Bachelor of Commerce degree and an Intermediate certificate from ICAI. He leads production, HR, and administration, and is
actively involved in business development.
Liquidity: Stretched
The company has tightly matched cash accruals for FY25 against its scheduled term debt obligation. Further, since the
procurement of the raw material is seasonal in nature, the working capital requirements of the company remain at elevated levels
during the season. The average working capital utilization for the trailing twelve months ending September 2024 stood at ~49%
with the highest average utilization of ~79% in the month of May 2024. The company’s ability to manage its working capital

requirements efficiently will remain a key monitorable. MFL’s current ratio and quick ratio stood at 2.07x and 1.35x, respectively,
as on March 31, 2024 (PY: 1.38x and 0.79x, respectively).

Press Release
Modison Limited
December 30, 2024
Facilities/Instruments Amount (₹ crore) Ratings1 Rating Action
90.00
Long-term bank facilities CARE A; Stable Reaffirmed
(Enhanced from 60.00)
Short-term bank facilities 17.50 CARE A1 Reaffirmed
Details of instruments/facilities in Annexure-1.
Rationale and key rating drivers
Ratings assigned to bank facilities of Modison Limited (Modison) continue to derive strength from its experienced promoters,
strong market position in India in manufacturing electrical contacts and reputed customer and supplier base. Ratings further
derive strength from moderate scale of operations, comfortable capital structure and adequate liquidity position.
However, rating strengths continue to remain constrained by elongated working capital cycle and profitability susceptible to
fluctuations in raw material prices and foreign exchange rates.
CARE Ratings Limited (CARE Ratings) has withdrawn the rating assigned to one of Modison’s working capital facilities with
immediate effect, as Modison has surrendered it and there is no amount outstanding as on date.
Rating sensitivities: Factors likely to lead to rating actions
Positive factors
• Improvement in profit before interest, lease rentals, depreciation and tax (PBILDT) margin to over 15% on a sustained
basis and return on capital employed (ROCE) of 18%.
• Operating cycle of below 90 days on a sustained basis.
Negative factors
• Deterioration in PBILDT margin beyond 7% on a sustained basis.
• Higher-than-envisaged level of debt resulting in deterioration of capital structure to above 0.30x on a sustained basis.
• Deterioration in total debt to PBILDT above 1.50x.
Analytical approach: Standalone
Outlook: Stable
Stable outlook reflects CARE Ratings’ expectation that the company will continue to benefit from its established and reputed
customer base and will sustain its financial risk profile in the medium term.
Detailed description of key rating drivers:
Key strengths
Strong business profile
Modison is a leading manufacturer of silver/copper/tungsten based electrical contacts for high, medium and low voltage (HV, MV
& LV) switchgears, serving domestic and international markets. Modison has an integrated presence, encompassing silver refining,
production of electrical contact materials, and manufacturing of finished contacts. LV (including MV) and HV contribute nearly
75% and 25% respectively to the company’s net sales.
Established customer and supplier base
Modison has an established customer base, catering to some of the top switchgear manufacturers in India. Top five customers
accounted for ~40-45% of total operating income (TOI) in the last three years. Further, Modison procures its key raw materials
such as silver, copper and tungsten from reputed suppliers. Top five suppliers accounted for ~65-70% of purchases in the last
three years. The company’s high dependence on customers and suppliers leads to concentration risk. However, long-term
relationship with them helps mitigate risks to a large extent.
Growing-yet-moderate scale of operations
In FY24 (refers to period April 01 to March 31), the company’s TOI increased by ~20% to ₹404.79 crore (PY: ₹335.78 crore),
largely driven by higher demand from the LV segment. Furthermore, the company booked TOI of ₹240.91 crore in H1FY25 (refers
to April 01 to September 30). Modison has an unexecuted orderbook of ~₹100 crore as on December 15, 2024, providing short-
term revenue visibility.
1Complete definition of ratings assigned are available at www.careedge.in and other CARE Ratings Limited’s publications.
1 CARE Ratings Ltd.
Press Release
Comfortable capital structure and debt coverage indicators
Modison’s debt profile as on March 31, 2024, consisted of working capital borrowings and minimal term debt. The capital structure
continues to remain comfortable with overall gearing of 0.16x as on March 31, 2024 (PY: 0.03x), despite higher utilisation of
working capital limits as on balance sheet date. In the absence of debt-funded capex, the capital structure is expected to remain
comfortable in the medium term.
Debt coverage indicators continued to remain comfortable with interest coverage and total debt to gross cash accruals (TD/GCA)
of 11.04x and 1.12x respectively in FY24 (PY: 14.21x and 0.31x respectively).
Experienced promoters and long track record of operations
Modison was established by Girdharilal Modi in 1965 as a trading unit. A decade later in 1975, the first manufacturing facility was
set up in Mumbai for refining of silver. In 1978, the promoter started manufacturing of electrical contacts. Girdharilal Modi has
over four decades of experience in the electrical equipment industry and has been instrumental in establishing the company as
one of the leading electrical contacts manufacturing companies in India. He is supported by Jay Kumar Modi (son), Rajkumar
Modi (relative) and Murli Nikam (CEO). Promoters are well-supported by a qualified team of professionals with significant
experience in their respective fields.
Key weaknesses
Fluctuating profitability with volatility in raw material prices and forex rates
PBILDT margin exhibited a declining trend during FY21-23 from 13% to 7% primarily due to volatile input prices and competitive
pressure in the global market. However, PBILDT margin improved marginally to 7.96% in FY24 (PY: 7.63%). Further, the company
has reported PBILDT margin of 8.39% in H1FY25.
Modison is exposed to the inherent risk of price fluctuations in its major raw materials, particularly silver, which accounts for ~75-
80% of raw material purchases. To manage volatility risk, Modison hedges part of its inventory, depending on market dynamics.
However, the company does not have a defined hedging policy. The company is also exposed to fluctuations in forex rates with
~15% of net sales from exports and ~10% of purchases from imports. Modison follows natural hedging and also enters forex-
forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk.
The profit after tax (PAT) margin improved to 5.27% in FY24 (PY: 3.33%) owing to gain of ₹5.59 crore booked in hedging of
silver and forex forward contracts. In H1FY25, Modison booked a loss of ₹1.52 crore (H1FY24: gain of ₹2.51 crore) on hedging
of silver and a forex gain of ₹0.25 crore (H1FY24: gain of ₹2.19 crore). Profitability margins remain monitorable with fluctuations
in silver prices and forex rates.
Elongated working capital cycle
The company’s operations remain working capital intensive with gross current asset of 158 days and operating cycle of 128 days
in FY24 (PY: 135 days). Most of the working capital is blocked in inventory, as Modison needs to maintain sufficient inventory for
continuous manufacturing requirements.
Modison generally gives a credit period of ~60 to 90 days to its customers. Considering the reputed customer profile, credit risk
remains low. With higher inventory holding period, higher collection period and minimal creditors’ period, the operating cycle is
elongated. Currently, working capital requirements are funded through a mix of internal accruals and working capital limits from
banks.
Liquidity: Adequate
The company’s liquidity position continues to remain adequate as marked by annual GCA of ₹30-35 crore against nil repayment
obligations. Average maximum utilisation of fund-based limits and non-fund-based limits stood at ~86% and ~9% respectively
for 12-months ended October 31, 2024. Unutilised credit lines provide additional comfort and are sufficient to meet incremental
the company’s working capital requirements.

Detailed Rationale
Infomerics Valuation and Rating Private Limited (IVR) has reaffirmed long term rating at IVR
A-/Stable and short-term rating at IVR A2+ for the bank loan facilities of Indo Farm
Equipment Limited (IFEL).
The rating continues to draw comfort from the established track record of operations and
experienced management, widespread dealer network, comfortable debt protection metrics
and financial risk profile and profitability margins during FY2024. However, these strengths
are partially offset by elongated working capital cycle, stiff competition in the industry,
exposure to group company and cyclical nature of industry.
The ‘Stable’ outlook indicates low likelihood of rating change over the medium term. IVR
believes IFEL business risk profile will be maintained over the medium term. The company
performance remained satisfactory in FY2024.
IVR has principally relied on the standalone audited financial results of IFEL upto 31 March
2023, FY2024 (refers to period April 1st, 2023, to March 31, 2024) unaudited certified
provisional results and projected financials for FY2025, FY2026 and FY2027, and publicly
available information/ clarifications provided by the company’s management.
1
Key Rating Sensitivities:
Upward Factors
• Substantial improvement in the scale of operations with TOI above Rs. 420 crore
and profitability margins
• Improvement in debt protection metrics
• Sustenance of the overall gearing
• Reduction in financial exposure to group company
Downward Factors
• Significant reduction in the scale of operations and profitability margins,
• Deterioration in debt protection metrics and overall gearing
• Liability arising on account of corporate guarantee given to group company and
further increase outstanding guaranteed borrowings
List of Key Rating Drivers with Detailed Description
Key Rating Strengths:
• Established track record of operations and experienced management:
The company commenced its commercial operations from 2000 and has a
successful track record of more than two decades in the manufacturing of agricultural
and construction equipment. Overall activities of IFEL are managed by 3 directors
with Mr. Ranbir Singh Khadwalia being the Managing Director. He has experience of
more than 3 decades in the existing line of business. He is ably supported by other
directors who have effective experience in existing line of business as well as
supported by qualified and well experienced management team.
• Widespread dealer network:
IFEL operates on a pan India basis and is a well-recognized brand in the industry. It
is also engaged in exports to more than 8 countries in the world. The company
operates through 15 regional offices and a 150 plus dealer network for sales and
services, spread across the country.
• Improved profitability margins:
The company’s operating profit and net profit margins improved to 12.92% and
3.81% respectively in FY2024 (Provisional) as compared to 12.05% and 3.50%
respectively in FY2023, mainly due to increase in sale of construction equipment.
2
• Comfortable debt protection metrics and financial risk profile:
In terms of the debt coverage indicators, the interest service coverage ratio
(ISCR) and the debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) remained comfortable at
2.66x and 1.41x respectively in FY2024 (Provisional). The adjusted tangible
networth remained comfortable at Rs. 271.29 crore in FY2024 (Provisional).
Overall adjusted gearing stood comfortable at 0.62x FY2024 (Provisional). The
total operating income (TOI) stood at Rs. 352.46 crore in FY2024 (Provisional)
from Rs. 346.62 crore in FY2023.
Key Rating Weaknesses:
• Elongated working capital cycle
The company’s operating cycle stood at 245 days in FY2024 (Provisional) as
compared to 224 days in FY2023. The elongated cycle is majorly attributable to a
high inventory holding period of 195 days in FY2024 (Provisional). The company
manufactures a wide range of models both in the tractor and crane segments. The
company has high level of backward integration and manufactures majority of the
components in house i.e., casting components, machining, hydraulic components,
gears, sheet and heavy metal fabrication etc., leading to a high inventory holding
period. Further, the sale of tractors is linked to harvest time for the next sowing
season for which the company has to maintain an adequate inventory prior to harvest
season in order to meet surge in demand.
• Stiff competition in the industry
The Indian tractor industry is the largest in the world, accounting for one third of the
global production. IFEL faces stiff competition from large established players in the
industry like Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., Tractors and Farm Equipment Ltd. etc. IFEL
produces less than 1% of the industry’s sales volume. However, with its presence in
the 22 HP-100 HP segment, IFEL is able to cater to a wide range of customers.
• Exposure to group company
IFEL provides comfort to group company in the form of investments, advances and
corporate guarantee given to it. The company has invested Rs ~25 crore (equity of
Rs. 20 crore and advances of Rs. ~5 crore) and extended a corporate guarantee of
Rs 195 crore in the group company “Barota Finance Limited (BFL)” and holds 100%
of its shareholding. BFL is an NBFC provides custom finance solutions to farmers to
help them own agricultural equipment.
3
• Cyclical nature of the industry
Around 94% of the company’s revenue comes from the tractor division and mobile
crane division. The demand for tractors in India is determined by multiple variables,
such as monsoon, crop prices, farmers sentiments and availability of finance. This
can have an impact on the company’s earnings and cash accruals in periods of
unfavorable monsoons. The demand for mobile cranes in India is expected to
improve in coming years due to increasing infrastructural and industrial activities in
the country. Though IFEL is likely to remain exposed to such vagaries in demand, the
Government of India’s commitment towards rural development, agri mechanization
and infrastructure development, while focusing on improving the country’s
infrastructure with enhanced budgetary allocations, is likely to aid a growth in
volumes over the medium to long-term.
Analytical Approach: For arriving at the ratings, IVR has analysed IFEL’s credit profile by
considering the Standalone financial statements of the company.
Applicable Criteria:
Rating Methodology for Manufacturing Companies
Financial Ratios & Interpretation (Non-Financial Sector)
Criteria for Assigning Rating Outlook
Policy on Default Recognition
Complexity Level of Rated Instruments/Facilities
Liquidity – Adequate
The company has an adequate liquidity position. There are secured term loans from banks,
amounting to Rs. 34.29 crore, as on 31st March 2024. Against a current portion of long-term
debt (CPLTD) of Rs 11.83 crore in FY2024 (Provisional), the company had a cash accrual of
Rs. 23.65 crore in FY2024 (Provisional). The company projected to generate cash accruals
of Rs. 33.00 crore in FY2025 against a CPLTD of Rs. 13.37 crore. With the adequate
expected cash accruals against repayments, the liquidity position will remain adequate.
About the Company
Indo Farm Equipment Limited (IFEL) was incorporated in the year 1994 and commenced its
commercial production of tractors in October 2000 and in 2008, the company diversified into
manufacturing and marketing of Pick-N-Carry cranes of 9 tonnes – 30 tonnes capacity and

Details of Facilities/Instruments are in Annexure 1. Facility wise lender details are at
Annexure 2. Detailed explanation of covenants is at Annexure 3.
Detailed Rationale
Infomerics has placed the rating under watch with developing implications to the Bank facilities
of Rana Sugars Limited (RSL) considering the search and seizure operation conducted at all
the commercial offices, manufacturing facilities of RSL as well as its group companies and
directors. The implications or any adverse findings against the RSL or its management
resulting from the search will remain a key rating monitorable.
The rating also takes the cognizance of the expected improvement in performance in H2FY25
and beyond. Further, the rating continues to take comfort from the experienced promoters with
long track record in sugar industry, integrated nature of operations, PPAs providing long term
revenue visibility, healthy financial risk profile, and its adequate liquidity position.
The rating however remains constrained by the subdued performance in H1FY25, working
capital-intensive operations, cyclicality in the sugar business, exposed to vagaries of nature,
exposure to risk related to government regulations and cyclical nature of the sugar business.
Key Rating Sensitivities:
1
Upward Factors
• Sustained increase in scale of operation of more than 15% in coming years with
improvement in cash accruals.
• Improvement in profitability metrics with EBITDA margin above 13% on a
sustained basis
• Improvement in capital structure with reduction in overall gearing below 0.10x.
Downward Factors
• Any adverse impact on the company operational / financial performance on
account of SEBI order or adverse findings from the Income Tax (IT) search and
seizure conducted
• Sharp decline in sugar prices, cane crushing volumes, recovery rate or an
increase in cane costs; or any significant decline in ethanol realizations or
material change in Government policies resulting in moderation of profitability
and debt coverage metrics.
• Deterioration in working capital management impacting the liquidity or sizeable
capital expenditure weakening the financial risk profile.
List of Key Rating Drivers with Detailed Description
Key Rating Strengths
Experienced promoters with long track record in sugar industry
The company was managed by the promoter Rana Inder Pratap Singh (Ex-Managing
Director), Mr. Rana Veer Pratap Singh (Manging Director) and Mr. Rana Ranjit Singh
(Director) and have established healthy customer and suppliers’ relations over the years.
Recently Rana Inder Pratap Singh has stepped down from his post as MD of the company
and Mr. Rana Veer Pratap Singh has taken his place as the MD of RSL. Even Mr. Rana Veer
Pratap Singh has extensive experience from the same company and other group companies.
Integrated nature of operations
RSL operations are fully integrated in nature which has led to better absorption of fixed cost
and any increase in the raw material cost. The company is having its operations in the State
of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh and is principally engaged in the manufacturing of Sugar, Ethanol
2
and cogeneration of power. The cogeneration and distillery units provide alternate revenue
streams and some cushion against cyclicality in sugar business. Furthermore, integrated
nature of operations supports overall profitability of RSL. As a result of the integrated nature
of operations the operating margin of the society have ranged between 4-10% over the last
four years.
PPAs providing long term revenue visibility
RSL has installed a 112.65 MW co-generation power. Power is used captively as well as
exported to the State Grids of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh respectively under long term Power
Purchase Agreements (PPA). The company has 3 PPA for its 3 units in Moradabad, Rampur
and Buttar with tenure of the agreement is of 20 years from the date of commission of plant
i.e. till Jan 2027.
Healthy financial risk profile
RSL’s total operating income (TOI) reduced by 2.14% in FY24 (refers to the period from April
01, 2023 to March 31, 2024) as compared to FY23 (refers to the period from April 01, 2022 to
March 31, 2023) and stood at Rs.1592.62 crore, as a result of decline in the turnover in all the
three segments. At the same time the margins showed decline in trend with EBITDA margin
of 5.20% and PAT margin of 1.74% (FY23 : 6.96% & 3.84% respectively). With the dip in the
profitability the GCA reduced by ~35% to Rs.66.63 crore in FY24 from Rs.104.22 crore in
FY23. The overall gearing and TOL/TNW ratios continued to remain comfortable at 0.75x and
1.79x respectively as on March 31, 2024 as against 0.73x and 1.86x reported as on March
31, 2023, respectively, mainly due to the accretion of the profits earned for the year to the
reserves. Due to the decline in profitability on y-o-y basis, the interest coverage ratio and total
debt/ NCA moderated from 4.95x to 3.59x respectively reported as on March 31, 2023 to 2.92x
and 6.05x respectively reported as on March 31, 2024. The company’s revenue remained
largely stable between Rs.840-850 crore for the period H1FY24 and H1FY25. Due to the
seasonality of the product, and also due to the repairs and maintenance leading to closure of
the plant, the company reported a loss of around Rs.14.78 crore in Q2FY25, overall the
company has reported a loss of Rs.12.88 crore in H1FY25, vis-à-vis the nominal profit reported
of Rs.0.77 crore reported in H1FY24. Infomerics expects improvement in the performance in
H2FY25.

Key Rating Weaknesses
SEBI order dated August 27, 2024 against RSL as well as the IT search and seizure
conducted in February 2025
SEBI, under Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities
Market) Regulations, 2003 ( “PFUTP Regulations”) and Securities and Exchange Board of
India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulation, 2015 (“LODR
Regulations”), investigated the financials of RSL for a period starting from FY15 to FY21. Upon
investigation SEBI alleged that the company along with its promoter directors including its
Managing Director, Chairman and other family members has diverted funds to the accounts
of the promoter group and family through some non-disclosed group companies which are
indirectly controlled by the Ex-Managing Director of RSL, ie Mr Rana Inder Pratap Singh. Also
SEBI observed that funds transferred to these group companies were interest free. Through
numerous summons explanations were called from RSL, its directors and the non-disclosed
group companies, as mentioned in the SEBI order, however majority of the questions
remained unanswered. A total of Rs.339 crore as loans and advances with an interest loss
calculated for RSL to the tune of Rs.268 crore (considering 12% rate of interest p.a.), leading
to Rs.607 crore, has to be returned / paid to RSL. SEBI has charged Rs.7 crore to RSL and
penalties in the range of Rs.3-7 crore to individual directors. Also, certain restrictions have
been placed on the directors against taking a part of board for any other listed company for a
period of 2 years and refrained them from buying or selling any securities. RSL has filed an
appeal against the order with Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) and availed a stay against
any coercive action taken against RSL and its promoters. As per the latest development, the
said appeal has been admitted by SAT.
Subsequently in the month of February 2025, the Income tax department conducted a search
and seizure on all the premises of RSL as well as its group companies and its directors. The
search has not been concluded yet and the impact of the said search is not yet established.
Any adverse developments regarding the SEBI order or the search conducted by IT
department will remain a key rating monitorable.
Working capital intensive operations, cyclicality in the sugar business
Since sugar is an agro-based commodity. Hence, the sugar inventory is piled up during the
crushing season and gradually released till the commencement of the next crushing season,
resulting into high inventory carrying cost, high inventory days and requirement of higher
4
working capital. RSL’s operating cycle continued to remain moderate at 68 days as on March
31, 2024. However, RSL’s inventory days remained elongated at 142 days, which was funded
from the creditor days of 105 days, as on balance sheet date and this was mainly in lines with
the nature of business of the company.
Exposed to vagaries of nature
Being an agro-based industry, performance of RSL is dependent on the availability of
sugarcane crop and its yield, which may get adversely affected due to adverse weather
conditions. The climatic conditions and pest related attacks have a bearing on the cane output,
which is the primary feedstock for a sugar producer. Climatic conditions, to be precise the
monsoons influence various operational structures for a sugar entity, such as the crushing
period and sugar recovery levels. Furthermore, the recent red rot prevailing in the entire state
of UP has adversely impacted the sugarcane production. New seeds has been developed to
cater to this red rot problem, however the effectiveness will be established in due course. In
addition, the degree of dispersion of monsoon precipitation across the sugar cane growing
areas also leads to fluctuating trends in sugar production in different regions.
Exposure to risk related to government regulations
The Sugar industry is highly exposed to risks related to Government regulations. Various
Government Acts virtually governs all aspects of the business, which include the availability
and pricing of sugarcane, sugar trade and by - product pricing. Government intervention also
exists to control the sugar prices to curb food inflation and stabilize the sugar prices in the
domestic market. Moreover, ethanol-blending policy is also highly regulated by the
government. Vulnerability in business due to Government regulations is likely to continue over
the medium term.
Cyclical nature of the sugar business
The key parameters of the sugar supply in the domestic market for a given sugar season are
typically controlled by factor like domestic sugar production, opening sugar stock levels and
global sugar production and sugar imports. The industry is highly cyclical in nature because
of variations in the sugarcane production in the country with typical sugar cycles lasting three
5
five years, as production adjusts to the fall in prices, which in turn leads to lower supplies,
price increase and higher production

Liquidity – Adequate
RSL’s liquidity position remained adequate marked by average repayment of around Rs.14 –
24 crore in the projected period from FY25 to FY27, against the projected GCA of Rs.94-100
crore. Due to the increase in the working capital requirements and capex expansion of around
Rs.96.54 crore in the year FY24 through internal accruals, the current ratio moderated on y-
o-y basis to 1.06x, from 1.11x, albeit remained above unity. Due to the nature of the business
and the seasonality of the product, the inventory remained high as on March 31, 2024, leading
to elongated inventory holding period of 142 days as on March 31, 2024, primarily funded
through high creditor holding period of 105 days. Cash and Cash equivalents stood at
Rs.12.67 crore as on FY24 end. Further, RSL has envisaged capex of Rs.90 crore during
FY24-FY26 which will be majorly funded through internal accruals. Also, the utilization of the
fund based limits remained moderate with ~83% average utilization for the past 12 months
ended in April 2024.
About the Company
RSL was incorporated in 1991. RSL operates in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, and is primarily
engaged in the manufacturing of sugar, ethanol and co-generation of power. Power is used
captively as well as sold to the State Grids of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh respectively under

*Instrument details are provided in Annexure-I
Rationale
The reaffirmation of the ratings takes into account a healthy order book position of Premier Explosives Limited (PEL) as on June
30, 2024, providing near to medium-term revenue visibility. The company had an outstanding order book of ~Rs. 899 crore as
on June 30, 2024. Further, majority of this order book (~85%) is from the margin-accretive defence segment. The robust order
book and a favourable demand outlook for the defence segment is expected to result in a healthy growth in the company’s
scale of operations in the near to medium term.
The Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan of the Government of India (GoI), which is aimed at curtailing import dependence and
increasing the sourcing of indigenous defence products, presents large growth opportunities for the company. ICRA also notes
the favourable demand prospects, fuelled by the growth in the end-user industries. The company’s marquee clientele,
comprising Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL), Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL) and Indian Space Research
Organisation (ISRO), and the repeat orders from many customers also provide comfort.
There has been a significant improvement in PEL’s operating profit in FY2024, driven by increasing revenue contribution from
the high-margin defence segment. While the operating profit is expected to be healthy in the near to medium term, supported
by the execution of margin-accretive defence orders. However, the likely levy of liquidated damages (LD) to impact the
profitability. In FY2024, the company had received orders worth ~Rs. 533 crore (3 orders) towards the supply of chaffs and
flares. The LD is likely to be levied as the supply for the orders has not been completed within the timeline due to challenges
in securing raw material and components because of various geopolitical challenges.
The ratings are constrained by the high working capital intensity owing to the long receivable cycle of the defence segment,
which can stretch up to three to six months. The ratings also consider the vulnerability of the commercial explosive segment’s
profitability to the volatility in raw material prices as the pass-through may be with a lag amid intense pricing competition.
Further, the customer concentration remains high for PEL. ICRA also notes the highly regulated nature of the explosives
manufacturing industry with the need for licensing for various products. Therefore, the company’s operations remain
vulnerable to any changes in the regulatory framework.

The Stable outlook on the long-term rating reflects ICRA’s expectation that PEL is likely to sustain its operating metrics. Further,
the outlook underlines ICRA’s expectation that the entity’s incremental capex, aimed at expanding the product portfolio, will
be funded in a manner that it is able to durably maintain its debt protection metrics commensurate with the existing ratings.
Key rating drivers and their description
Credit strengths
Reputed client profile in commercial explosives, defence and aerospace segments – The company has been present in the
commercial explosives business for about four decades and is one of the well-known players in the space. PEL continues to
have marquee clients in the mining and infrastructure industries, such as Singareni Collieries Company Limited. Further, PEL is
one of the few private players supplying chemicals/explosives for the defence sector and benefits from its technological
expertise in the segment. The company has also entered the Indian Space programme as an approved supplier of PSOM XL
motors to ISRO for use in polar satellite launch vehicles (PSLV).
Increasing share of margin-accretive defence business in order book provides revenue visibility – The company had a healthy
outstanding order book of ~Rs. 899 crore as on June 30, 2024. Majority of this order book (~85%) is from the margin-accretive
defence segment. The robust order book and favourable demand outlook for the defence segment is expected to result in a
healthy growth in the company’s scale of operations in the near to medium term. ICRA notes a significant improvement in
PEL’s operating profit in FY2024, driven by increasing revenue contribution from the high-margin defence segment. While the
operating profit is expected to be healthy in the near to medium term, supported by the execution of margin-accretive defence
orders. However, likely a likely levy of liquidated damages (LD) to impact the profitability. In FY2024, the company had received
orders worth ~Rs. 533 crore (3 orders) towards the supply of chaffs and flares. The LD is likely to be levied as the supply for
the orders has not been completed within the timeline due to challenges in securing raw material and components because
of various geopolitical challenges.
Comfortable capital structure – PEL’s capital structure continues to be comfortable with a gearing of 0.3 times as on March
31, 2024. The expected revenue growth and healthy profitability is likely to keep the company’s gearing at similar levels.
Favourable demand prospects with end-user industries demonstrating growth – The company caters to the demand of end-
user industries, such as mining, infrastructure, defence and aerospace. The demand prospects for the company’s products are
expected to increase with the Government’s rising budgetary allocation towards defence. Also, the Government’s
announcement of a negative list of imports to encourage domestic procurement and the permission to export select products
offer opportunity for the company in defence supplies. However, the tender-based bidding and the long-drawn approval
process may bring in lumpiness in revenues from this segment.
Credit challenges
High working capital intensity – PEL’s operations are working capital-intensive. Its receivables in the commercial explosives
segment are paid within 30 days, while those in the defence segment are paid in 3-6 months. However, PEL’s working capital
intensity moderated in FY2024 due to advances from customers against certain defence orders, supporting the company’s
working capital requirement.
Bulk explosives segment vulnerable to volatility in raw material prices – The price of ammonium nitrate - the key raw material
used in manufacturing commercial explosives - can be volatile. The extent of the pass-through of input price hikes is limited as
the company does have pass-through clauses in the contracts with its clients, exposing PEL’s profitability to adverse raw
material price movements. The defence segment also inks fixed-price contracts. Any adverse movement in raw material prices
can also impact the profitability of the defence segment although the inputs used in this segment tend to be less volatile.
High customer concentration; intense price competition in commercial explosives – The customer concentration of the
company is high; the top five customers contributed to ~69%of the revenues in FY2024. Further, the commercial explosives
www.icra .in 2
Page |
segment remains highly competitive because of the fragmented industry structure, the commoditised nature of the products
in the trade segment and the tender-based order procurement with Government entities.
Exposure to regulatory risks - PEL operates in a highly regulated explosives manufacturing industry with high entry barriers.
Its operations, therefore, remain vulnerable to any changes in the regulatory framework impacting the industry.
ESG risks
Environmental risk - The industry is exposed to the risk of tightening regulatory norms for production, water management,
waste and hazardous material management, given the safety and environment-related concerns associated with explosives.
Additionally, some products can face restrictions/substitution over time because of their hazardous nature. Further, in the
event of accidents, the litigation risks could be high. While the company has a demonstrated track record of running its
operations safely, the nature of the risk weighs on its rating.
Social risk - Companies like PEL need to operate responsibly as it is an imperative and instances of non-compliance with
environmental, health and safety norms could have an adverse impact on the local community which could manifest in the
form of protests, constraining the ability to operate or expand capacity. The company hasn’t experienced/reported any
incident suggestive of safety lapses at its manufacturing facilities over the past several years and its ability to maintain the
manufacturing controls would be monitorable.
Liquidity position: Adequate
PEL’s liquidity position is expected to remain adequate amid expectations of healthy cash generation and moderate debt
repayments. The cash generation is expected to be healthy with the higher execution of margin-accretive defence orders and
advances from customers that will keep the liquidity position adequate. The average utilisation of the fund-based limits in the
last 12 months ended March 2024 is 54% against the sanctioned limit and 47% against the drawing power.
Rating sensitivities
Positive factors – ICRA could upgrade PEL’s ratings if the company witnesses a sustained improvement in its scale, profitability
and liquidity. A specific credit metrics that could lead to an upgrade is RoCE of more than 16% and interest coverage of more
than 5 times on a sustained basis.
Negative factors – Pressure on PEL’s ratings could arise if the company witnesses weak revenue growth/profit margins. A
significant debt-funded capex could also exert pressure on the ratings. A specific credit metric that could lead to a downgrade
would be an interest coverage of less than 3.5 times on a sustained basis. Any deterioration in the company’s liquidity position
could also lead to a downgrade.

Long term - Unallocated 18.41 0.00 -
Total 670.00 670.00
*Instrument details are provided in Annexure-I
Rationale
The reaffirmation of the ratings continues to factor in the extensive experience of the promoters of MTAR Technologies Limited
(MTL) and its track record in the precision engineering industry, which caters to various segments, including clean energy,
nuclear, space, aerospace and defence. Also, the established relationship with renowned clients, including the Indian Space
Research Organisation (ISRO), Bloom Energy Corporation (Bloom), Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCIL) and Defence
Research and Development Laboratory (DRDL), among others, has ensured repeat orders from its customers over the years.
Further, the company is developing new products as well as acquiring new clients, both of which are expected to augment the
revenues, going forward. Moreover, MTL is the key supplier of several products to its clients, indicating its expertise in
manufacturing niche and quality products, which limits competition.
The ratings also take into account MTAR’s healthy financial risk profile, with a comfortable capital structure and debt
protection metrics. ICRA notes the moderation in revenue and profitability in FY2024, which has moderated the coverage
indicators. However, the company is expected to report healthy revenue growth in FY2025, supported by a strong order book
position of ~Rs. 894 crore as of June 2024. Further, the growth momentum is expected to sustain in the medium term,
supported by healthy orders in the pipeline from domestic and international clients.
The ratings, however, are constrained by high customer concentration as the company derives a major share of its revenues
from one client i.e., Bloom Energy Corporation. Further, the ratings consider the company’s working capital-intensive
operations owing to the long production and receivable cycle inherent to the industry. The ratings also consider the
vulnerability of its margins to the fluctuations in forex rates to the extent of the unhedged position and the margins vary,
depending on the segment and customer mix.
The Stable outlook reflects ICRA’s expectations that the company is likely to sustain its operating metrics. Further, the outlook
underlines ICRA’s expectation that the entity’s incremental capex, which will help expand the product portfolio, will be funded
in a manner that it is able to durably maintain its debt protection metrics commensurate with the existing rating.

Key rating drivers and their description
Credit strengths
Extensive experience of promoters and established track record in engineering industry – MTL, established in 1970, draws
comfort from the vast experience of its promoters and has developed strong in-house R&D capabilities over the years. The
company has an established presence in the engineering industry, which caters to varied segments, including clean energy,
nuclear power, space, aerospace and defence. MTL is the key supplier of several products to its clients, indicating its expertise
in manufacturing niche and quality products, which limits competition. The company has a renowned client base, including
reputed players such as Bloom Energy Corporation, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), Nuclear Power Corporation of
India (NPCIL) and Defence Research and Development Laboratory (DRDL), among others. It has established relationship with
its customers and has been receiving repeat orders from its clients.
Healthy order book position – The company had an unexecuted order book of Rs. 894 crore as of June 2024, which provides
revenue visibility for the near to medium term. Further, the company expects to receive healthy incremental orders over the
next 12 months. The company is adding new products to its portfolio and acquiring clients in various segments, which is
expected to augment the revenues, going forward. Further, the favourable demand prospects in the end-user segments and
Government’s thrust on the indigenisation of production augur well for the company’s long-term growth prospects.
Comfortable capital structure and healthy debt protection metrics – The company’s capital structure continues to be
comfortable with a gearing of 0.3 times as on March 31, 2024, though it moderated from 0.2 times as on March 31, 2023, with
an increase in the long-term borrowing because of the debt-funded capex. In FY2024, the company undertook capex to
increase the capacity, set up specialised fabrication facilities and a new unit to cater to aerospace vertical.
The debt protection metrics remain healthy. However, the company’s revenue and profitability moderated in FY2024, thereby
moderating the coverage indicators, reflected in total debt/OPBDITA of 1.7 times and interest coverage of 5.1 times compared
to total debt/OPBDITA of 0.9 times and interest coverage of 10.6 times in FY2023. Nevertheless, the company is expected to
report healthy revenue growth in FY2025, supported by a strong order book position of ~Rs. 894 crore as of June 2024. Further,
the growth momentum is expected to sustain in the medium term, backed by the likely healthy orders in the pipeline from
domestic and international clients. The increase in the OI is likely to support the operating leverage, leading to an improvement
in the operating margins and healthy coverage indicators, going forward.
Credit challenges
High customer concentration risk – The company has high customer concentration. It derived more than 70% of its revenues
from a single customer - Bloom Energy Corporation - in FY2024 and Q1 FY2025. The company’s revenues and margins would
be adversely impacted if the offtake by the customer declines, as seen in FY2024, when the operating income was lower than
projected due to deferment of orders by Bloom Energy. Nevertheless, the overall client profile comprises reputed players with
repeat orders received over the years, largely mitigating the counterparty credit risk. A healthy order inflow from domestic
clients in the nuclear and space segments and new client acquisitions will be crucial in reducing the concentration risk over the
medium term.
Working capital-intensive operations – The company’s operations are working capital intensive, reflected in NWC/OI of ~71%
in FY2023 (64% as of FY2023) due to the long receivable cycle and high inventory holding requirements. The company extends
a credit period of up to 120 days to its customers and receives a credit period of 30-120 days from its import suppliers (majority
of the period is in transit time). As MTAR manufactures products with a long cycle, the inventory levels remain high. Further,
the sharp increase in the inventory levels in the recent past is attributable to the raw materials which are in transit. The overall
working capital intensity is expected to remain high in the medium term due to a growing order book and a relatively long
manufacturing cycle and lead time.

Exposure to fluctuations in forex rates – The company’s margins are exposed to the fluctuations in forex rates as MTL is a net
exporter. Thus, any sharp adverse movement in the forex rates can impact the realisations and the operating margins. The
margins also vary, depending on the segment and customer mix. However, the margins have remained healthy over the past
three years.
Environmental and Social Risks
Environmental considerations - The precision engineered systems manufacturing sector may face environmental risks due to
changing regulations, such as tighter energy and carbon norms. According to the disclosures made in the company’s annual
report, its operating units are compliant with the applicable environmental laws/regulations and guidelines, as per the national
and state-level mandates. Over the years, MTL has strategised to grow in the clean energy segment to manufacture climate-
positive products with majority of the revenue (~71% of total revenue in FY2024) derived from this segment, including civil
nuclear power and fuel cells. Further, the company has been taking steps to reduce its carbon footprint by enhancing its
reliance on renewable sources for power.
Social considerations -MTL, like most precision engineered systems suppliers, has a healthy dependence on human capital; as
such retaining human capital and maintaining healthy employee relations and a supplier ecosystem remains essential for
disruption-free operations of the entity. Another social risk that MTL faces pertains to product safety and quality, wherein
instances of product recalls may not only lead to financial implication but could also harm the reputation and create a more
long-lasting adverse impact. In this regard, MTL’s strong track record in catering to leading players in the industry underscores
its ability to mitigate these risks to an extent. The company’s strong technological capabilities are likely to help it align its
products with any change in customer preferences.
Liquidity position: Adequate
The company’s liquidity position is adequate with average fund-based working capital utilisation of 36% in the 15 months
ended July 2024. As on March 31, 2024, the company had free cash and liquid investments of Rs. 39 crore. Moreover, the
anticipated annual cash flows are expected to remain healthy against a repayment obligation of ~Rs. 45.5 crore in FY2025 and
Rs. 45 crore in FY2026.
Rating sensitivities
Positive factors - ICRA may upgrade the ratings if the company is able to sustain a healthy revenue growth, aided by
diversification of the customer base and improvement in the working capital cycle while maintaining healthy margins and
liquidity.
Negative factors - ICRA may downgrade the ratings if any significant reduction in margins or lower-than-expected accruals, or
if any stretch in the working capital cycle impacts its liquidity position, or if there is a higher-than-anticipated debt-funded
capex. Specific credit metrics that may downgrade MTL’s ratings include TD/OBDITA of more than 2 times on a sustained basis.

The engineering products division was set up in 1974 in Ropar, Punjab, as a division of DCM. It was hived off into DCME in 2004, following the restructuring of DCM's debt. DCME was merged with DCM in fiscal 2016. The engineering division is one of India's large independent manufacturers of grey iron castings, supplied to auto players (cars, multi-utility vehicles, tractors, light commercial vehicles, heavy commercial vehicles, and earth-moving equipment). DCM also specialises in cylinder heads, cylinder blocks, and housing. In IT division it provide services such as system administration, storage management, backup recovery, disaster management, and databases in the infrastructure service segment.

Rating Rationale Rating Rationale May 05, 2025 | Mumbai Indo Amines LimitedRatings reaffirmed at 'Crisil A-/Stable/Crisil A2+'; Rated amount enhanced for Bank Debt Rating ActionTotal Bank Loan Facilities RatedRs.420.15 Crore (Enhanced from Rs.310.15 Crore)Long Term RatingCrisil A-/Stable (Reaffirmed)Short Term RatingCrisil A2+ (Reaffirmed)Note: None of the Directors on Crisil Ratings Limited’s Board are members of rating committee and thus do not participate in discussion or assignment of any ratings. The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities Detailed Rationale Crisil Ratings has reaffirmed its 'Crisil A-/Stable/Crisil A2+' ratings on the bank facilities of Indo Amines Limited (IAL; part of the Indo Amines group) The ratings continue to reflect the established market position of the company backed by the extensive experience of the promoters in the chemical industry and the group’s healthy financial risk profile. These strengths are partially offset by susceptibility to commodity prices and large working capital requirement. Analytical Approach Crisil Ratings has combined the business and financial risk profiles of IAL and its subsidiaries: Indo Amines (Changzhou) Ltd, Indo Amines (Malaysia) SDN. BHD., Indo Amines Americas LLC, Indo Amines (Europe) Limited and Indo Speciality Chemical Pvt. Ltd (collectively referred to as the Indo Amines group). This is because these companies have significant business and financial linkages and common management. Please refer Annexure - List of Entities Consolidated, which captures the list of entities considered and their analytical treatment of consolidation. Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description Strengths: Established market position backed by the extensive experience of the promoters: IAL's promoters have been engaged in the chemical intermediates business for over three decades which has enabled them to develop a strong understanding of market dynamics and establish healthy relations with customers and suppliers. IAL has a diversified business profile with diversity at product, geography, customers and end-use industry level. The established market position and global competitiveness are also reflected in healthy growth of revenue at compound annual growth rate of 14.58% over the last three fiscals. Healthy financial risk profile: The financial risk profile was above average with robust networth of around Rs 293 crore as on September 30, 2024. This supports the financial flexibility of the group. Supported by robust networth, the capital structure was moderate with total outside liabilities to adjusted networth ratio of 0.91 time as on September 30, 2024. This is expected to remain comfortable. The capital structure is expected to improve over the medium term on the back of healthy accrual, absence of large debt-funded capital expenditure (capex) and scheduled repayment. The overall financial risk profile is expected to further improve over the medium term. Weaknesses: Susceptibility to commodity prices: The prices of raw material inputs, which are derivatives of crude oil, are volatile, thus impacting profitability. The international market prices of raw materials follow the petrochemicals cycle. However, order-backed sales and the ability to pass on volatility in raw material prices to customers will continue to mitigate this risk. The group’s operating margin has remained at 7.7-12.5% over the past five years through fiscal 2020 with the least (7.7%) in fiscal 2022. Large working capital requirement: Moderately high working capital requirement was reflected in gross current assets (GCAs) of 140 days as on March 31, 2024, driven by receivables and inventory of 84 days and 49 days, respectively. The working capital requirement was supported by payables of 64 days as on March 31, 2024 and by bank limit. GCAs days are expected at 149-150 days over the medium term Liquidity : Adequate Bank limit utilisation was low at 58.07% on average for the 12 months ended February 28, 2025. Annual cash accrual is expected to be over Rs 70 crore against yearly term debt obligation of Rs 25-30 crore over the medium term and will cushion liquidity Outlook: Stable Crisil Ratings believes the group will continue to benefit from its established market position, enhanced capacities and extensive industry experience of its promoters Rating sensitivity factors Upward factors: Healthy revenue growth driven by volume and operating margin improving over 11%, leading to more-than-expected net cash accrual Efficient working capital management, further strengthening the financial risk profile Downward factors: Further decline in revenue or operating profitability below 7%, leading to lower-than-expected net cash accrual Stretched working capital cycle or sizeable debt-funded capex, constraining the financial risk profile About the Group Incorporated in 1992, IAL manufactures fine and specialty chemicals used in several industries, including pharmaceutical, agrochemical, fertiliser, petrochemical, pesticide and perfumery. The company has five manufacturing units in Gujarat and Maharashtra. Operations are managed by Vijay Palkar (managing director and chief executive officer) and Rahul Palkar (joint managing director).

Rating Rationale Rating Rationale April 30, 2024 | Mumbai Savita Oil Technologies LimitedRatings reaffirmed at 'CRISIL AA/Stable/CRISIL A1+' Rating ActionTotal Bank Loan Facilities RatedRs.1102.9 CroreLong Term RatingCRISIL AA/Stable (Reaffirmed)Short Term RatingCRISIL A1+ (Reaffirmed)Note: None of the Directors on CRISIL Ratings Limited’s Board are members of rating committee and thus do not participate in discussion or assignment of any ratings. The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities Detailed Rationale CRISIL Ratings has reaffirmed its ‘CRISIL AA/Stable/CRISIL A1+’ ratings on the bank facilities of Savita Oil Technologies Limited (SOTL). The ratings continue to reflect the company’s established market position, diversified revenue profile basis across end user industries and products, and healthy financial risk profile. These strengths are partially offset by the susceptibility of its operating margin to sharp volatility in foreign exchange (forex) rates and base oil prices, working capital-intensive operations and exposure to intense competition. The company has an established market position in the domestic transformer oil and white oil segments, which contributed ~35% each to revenue during fiscal 2023. The other major product is lubricating oil, which forms 28% of the revenue. The volume in the transformer oil and lubricating oil segments has increased consistently over the past three years and the similar trend is expected to continue over the medium term aided by the government focus on infrastructure and demand from the automotive industry.  In fiscal 2024, SOTL started manufacturing synthetic ester-based transformer oil, which is more environment friendly. The Company during April, 2024 relaunched its own lubricant   brand as “Savsol Easter5”  to increase market share. The post pandemic pent-up demand during fiscal 2022 mainly from the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and pharmaceuticals sectors stabilised during fiscal 2023, resulting in a decline in the volume of white oil / liquid paraffin on a high base. The demand for white oil is expected to remain stable hereon. Savita Polymers Limited (SPL), formerly a 100% subsidiary of SOTL, merged with SOTL as per the NCLT order dated May 08, 2023. SPL was engaged in manufacturing of cable filling compounds, petroleum jellies, microcrystalline waxes, and specialty oils such as transformer oils and white oils at its plant situated in Mahad Maharashtra. SOTL registered 23% -on-year revenue growth during fiscal 2023 driven by increased realisation in line with base oil prices, the key raw material. During the nine months ended December 31, 2023, the volume growth of around 9% was partly offset by the decline in realisations, resulting in on-year revenue growth of 3%. Stable volume growth of 3-5% is expected over the medium term, driven by demand from end user industries such as power distribution, FMCG, pharmaceuticals and automobiles. SOTL is focusing on increasing revenue from exports (~20% of revenue currently). During fiscal 2023, the operating margin contracted by 300 basis points (bps) on-year to 9.4% due to rise in input costs., Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) per kilolitre  (KL ) remained largely stable at Rs 8,806 per KL as against Rs 9,288 per KL  in fiscal 2022, supported by stable volume and healthy realisations. As the company has to maintain inventory of 2-3 months at any given point of time, cooling input prices during the first half of fiscal 2024 resulted in carryforward of high-cost inventory. This impacted the gross margins and Ebitda per KL  was Rs 6,895 per KL. During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, the operating margin was 7.9% as against 10.5% in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal. Ebitda per KL  is expected to sustain at ~Rs 7,000 per KL, which will be higher than the pre-pandemic level, and operating margins at  ~8% over the medium term, supported by a better product mix. SOTL floated a 100% subsidiary, Savita Greentec Ltd (SGL), in October 2022. SGL will manufacture Recycled Polythelene Terephthalate (rPET) Flakes and rPET Pallets from PET waste bottle. The Company  is expected to commence operations within 24-30 months. The overall project cost is estimated at Rs 250 crore and will be funded entirely through internal accrual of SOTL. There are no plans to avail of external debt in both SOTL and SGL. SOTL infused Rs125 crore during fiscal 2024 by subscribing to Optionally Convertible Debentures (OCDs) issued on private placement basis. Land was purchased in Bharuch for Rs 65-70 crore during fiscal 2024. The balance capex will be spread over three years till fiscal 2027. Despite incurring annual capex of Rs 85-100 crore for SGL in addition to maintenance capex of Rs 30-35 crore, the financial risk profile of SOTL will continue to be strong supported by strong capital structure, debt free capex and healthy debt protection metrics. Adjusted networth stood at Rs.1448 crore and gearing was 0.27 times as on March 31, 2023. SOTL has no long-term debt, and its short-term debt is entirely because of trade acceptances for import of base oil. Gearing is expected to remain below ~0.3 times over the medium term. The debt protection metrics should remain healthy, too, with interest coverage expected over 8 times in the medium term. Analytical Approach CRISIL Ratings has combined the business and financial risk profiles of SOTL and SGL due to their common management and financial interlinkages. Please refer Annexure - List of entities consolidated, which captures the list of entities considered and their analytical treatment of consolidation. Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description Strengths: Established market position in the base oil industry SOTL has an established market position with one-third market share each in the domestic transformer oil and white oil segments. In the lubricating oil segment, the market share is relatively lower.  SOTL caters to established and reputed clients, including Hindustan Unilever Ltd (‘CRISIL AAA/Stable’), Dabur India Ltd (‘CRISIL AAA/Stable/CRISIL A1+’), ABB India Ltd (‘CRISIL AAA/Stable/CRISIL A1+’), in addition to various state electricity boards (SEBs). Demand for the company’s major three product segments– transformer oil, liquid paraffin /white oils and lubricating oil is expected to remain stable. Diversified revenue profile across end-user industries and geographies Diversity in end-user base and geographical reach lends stability to SOTL’s revenue profile. The company’s products (transformer oil, white oil, and lubricants) cater to three different end-user segments: power and distribution transformers, cosmetics and healthcare, and automotive and industrial lubricants, respectively. Exports which contribute 15-20% to revenue enhance the geographical outreach. Furthermore, SOTL’s wind power plants, aggregating 53.80 megawatt (MW), generated revenue of Rs 31 crore in fiscal 2023 from sale to SEBs and other customers. Healthy financial risk profile The capital structure should remain strong, with total outside liabilities to tangible networth (TOLTNW) ratio and adjusted gearing expected to remain below 0.5 time and 0.3 time, respectively, supported by healthy annual net cash accrual of Rs 170-190 crore, debt free capex and efficient working capital management. The TOLTNW ratio was 0.56 time and gearing 0.27 time as on March 31, 2023. Debt protection metrics will remain healthy, too (interest coverage was over 10 times for fiscal 2023). CRISIL Ratings believes SOTL will maintain healthy cash and equivalent of Rs 250 crore and above over the medium term. Weaknesses: Susceptibility to sharp volatility in forex rates and prices of base oil Base oil, the key raw material (constituting 85-90% of total input cost), is a crude derivative. Hence, its price is susceptible to any sharp volatility in crude prices. Moreover, as the company imports over 80% of its base oil requirement, on account of limited availability in the domestic market, it is exposed to sharp fluctuations in forex rates. Against this, exports comprise 15-20%of total revenue which act as natural hedge.  SOTL covers 40-50% of total forex exposure through forward contracts, options along with natural hedge. Working capital-intensive operations Gross current assets were at 160-240 days over the five years ended March 31, 2023, led by inventory of 77-95 days. The company has to maintain base oil inventory of 2-3 months given the transit time of 4-6 weeks. Focus on raising the revenue proportion of exports will lead to a moderate increase in receivables. . Exposure to intense competition Low entry barriers and limited product differentiation have led to intense competition in the base oil processing industry. Focus on volume leads to competitive pricing and players are unable to fully pass on any increase in base oil prices to customers immediately. However, SOTL can pass on increase in raw material cost with a lag. SOTL also benefits from technical approvals from key customers for the supply of products. This acts as an entry barrier as obtaining such approvals is time consuming for new entrants. Liquidity: Strong SOTL has strong liquidity, with cash and equivalent of Rs 348 crore as on September 30, 2023. Cash accrual is expected at Rs 170-190 crore over the medium term and will be sufficient to fund annual capex of ~Rs 65-120 crore. Fund-based bank limit of Rs 60 crore was unutilised over the 12 months through January 2024, and will provide financial cushion during any exigency.. Outlook: Stable CRISIL Ratings believes SOTL will benefit from its market leadership position, healthy product diversity and sound risk management practices. The company will maintain its healthy financial risk profile over the medium term, supported by its strong capital structure and liquidity. Rating Sensitivity factors Upward factors: Substantial increase in volumes while maintaining stability in operating margins at 10% on a sustained basis. Sustenance of healthy financial risk profile, and debt protection metrics. Downward factors: Substantial decline in business performance, and cash accrual with operating margins declining below 7% on sustained basis. Significant increase in debt in order to fund any large capex or stretch in the working capital cycle thereby impacting the financial risk profile. About the Company Established in 1961, SOTL is a leading player in the transformer oil, white oil, and industrial and automotive lubricants industries. These products are essentially obtained by refining base oil, and topping with additives to derive the required characteristics. The company’s facilities in Turbhe, and Mahad in Maharashtra; and Kharadpada and Silli in Silvassa have combined manufacturing capacities of  ~550,000 KL/MT per annum. The company also has wind power capacity of 53.80 MW; sold to SEBs and other users, under long-term agreements. For the nine months ended December 31, 2023, the company reported revenue of Rs 2768 crore (Rs 2675 crore for the corresponding period of previous fiscal) and net profit of Rs 170 crore (Rs 189 crore).

Rating Rationale Rating Rationale September 04, 2024 | Mumbai Medicamen Biotech LimitedRatings reaffirmed at 'CRISIL BBB-/Stable/CRISIL A3' Rating ActionTotal Bank Loan Facilities RatedRs.42 CroreLong Term RatingCRISIL BBB-/Stable (Reaffirmed)Short Term RatingCRISIL A3 (Reaffirmed)Note: None of the Directors on CRISIL Ratings Limited’s Board are members of rating committee and thus do not participate in discussion or assignment of any ratings. The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities Detailed Rationale CRISIL Ratings has reaffirmed its 'CRISIL BBB-/Stable/CRISIL A3' ratings on the bank loan facilities of Medicamen Biotech Ltd (MBL; part of the Medicamen group). The ratings continue to reflect the strong track record of the company in the pharmaceutical industry and its healthy financial risk profile. These strengths are partially offset by the modest scale of operations and large working capital requirement. Analytical approach CRISIL Ratings has combined the business and financial risk profiles of MBL and its subsidiary, Medicamen Life Sciences Pvt Ltd. These entities, collectively referred to as the Medicamen group, are in the same business and have common management and operational and financial linkages. Please refer Annexure - List of Entities Consolidated, which captures the list of entities considered and their analytical treatment of consolidation. Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description Strengths: Strong track record in the pharmaceutical industry: The promoters have experience of around three decades in the pharmaceuticals industry, and have a diversified clientele comprising the government sector and other customers across India and Africa. Operating income was around Rs 180.4 crore in fiscal 2024. Though clients from Africa contribute around 70% to the sales, MBL is also planning to start sales in European countries and the USA over the medium term, which will support the business risk profile. Furthermore, commercial production of oncology products started from January 2022 onwards, and the company supplies to the domestic market. After approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration, it will also supply to other emerging markets. Healthy financial risk profile: Gearing and total outside liabilities to adjusted networth ratio were strong at around 0.17 time and around 0.48 time, respectively, and networth large at around Rs 173 crore as on March 31, 2024. Debt protection metrics were also robust, with interest coverage and net cash accrual to adjusted debt (NCAAD) ratios of around 6.18 times and around 0.52 time, respectively, for fiscal 2024. Financial risk profile is expected to remain healthy over the medium term with networth of above Rs 193 crore, gearing of 0.09 time, and interest coverage and NCAAD ratios of 7 times and above 1 time, respectively. This will be supported by absence of any major debt-funded capital expenditure (capex) and steady accretion to reserve, along with minimal dividend payout of 10%. Weaknesses: Modest scale of operations: Scale of operations is moderate as reflected in operating income of around Rs 179 crore in fiscal 2024, showing a growth of around 28%. Operating margin declined from 18.35% in fiscal 2023 to 13.1% in fiscal 2024 on account of breakeven yet to be achieved for the oncology segment. Margin will be 14-15% as the company expects to achieve breakeven in fiscal 2025. MBL is planning to add new customers in the oncology and non-oncology segments over the medium term. Sustained offtake from the oncology segment, leading to improvement in the overall business risk profile, will remain monitorable. Large working capital requirement: Gross current assets (GCAs) were high at around 357 days as on March 31, 2024, due to stretched receivables of 103 days (despite improving from 160 days previous fiscal). This is because while the company gives credit of 21-25 days to domestic clients, payment from ROW (Rest of the World) takes 50-60 days to come, depending on shipment. Export recovery is also delayed due to lengthy invoicing and limited ship availability, causing long waits for shipments to Africa. Payments are usually backed by letter of credit, or in advance in case of exports. Large credit of 120-140 days extended by suppliers (active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturers) partly eases pressure on the working capital cycle. Prudent working capital management amid increasing scale of operations will be closely monitored. The GCAs are expected to be 320-340 days over the medium term. Liquidity: Adequate Bank limit utilisation averaged 47.17% for the 12 months through August 2024. Cash accrual of around Rs 15.9 crore was sufficient to meet debt obligation of around Rs 1.15 crore in fiscal 2024. Cash accrual is expected to remain above Rs 19 crore in fiscal 2025  along with annual debt obligation of Rs 1.25 crore for same fiscal.. The company has no debt obligation from fiscal 2026, which means net cash accrual will cushion liquidity. Dividend payout is estimated to be around 10% of paid-up capital. Outlook: Stable The company will continue to benefit from its strong track record in the pharmaceutical industry. Rating sensitivity factors Upwards factors: Growth in revenue to over Rs 200 crore and sustenance of operating margin at 15-16%, leading to higher-than-expected net cash accrual Prudent working capital cycle strengthening financial risk profile Downwards factors: Decline in revenue by over 20% and steep fall in operating margin leading to lower cash accrual Any substantial, debt-funded capex or further stretch in working capital cycle impacting financial risk profile and liquidity About the company MBL, incorporated in 1993, manufactures pharmaceutical formulations for the overseas and domestic markets. Formulations are based on betalactum and non-betalactum drugs. The company is listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). In November 2015, Shivalik Rasayan Ltd, another BSE-listed company, along with five persons acting in concert, had acquired 52% in MBL; Shivalik Rasayan Ltd currently has 41.6% holding in MBL. MBL has manufacturing facilities in Bhiwadi (Rajasthan) and Haridwar (Uttarakhand). About the group OPAL Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd-Australia is not operational. Medicamen Life Sciences Pvt Ltd was incorporated on August 12, 2022, to market pharmaceutical products in the domestic market.

Rating Rationale Rating Rationale July 01, 2024 | Mumbai DCM Nouvelle LimitedRatings reaffirmed at 'CRISIL BBB/Stable/CRISIL A3+' Rating ActionTotal Bank Loan Facilities RatedRs.439.72 CroreLong Term RatingCRISIL BBB/Stable (Reaffirmed)Short Term RatingCRISIL A3+ (Reaffirmed)Note: None of the Directors on CRISIL Ratings Limited’s Board are members of rating committee and thus do not participate in discussion or assignment of any ratings. The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities Detailed rationale CRISIL Ratings has reaffirmed its 'CRISIL BBB/Stable/CRISIL A3+’ ratings on the bank loan facilities of DCM Nouvelle Ltd (DNL). The ratings continue to reflect the stable business risk profile of the company, as indicated by operating margin of 4.6% in fiscal 2024 against 4.4% in fiscal 2023, driven by stable raw material prices on account of which debt protection metrics have weakened, particularly the interest coverage ratio to 2 times in fiscal 2024. Operating income grew 26% to Rs 1,088 crore in fiscal 2024, driven by volumetric growth. The operating income is expected to remain range bound at Rs 1,100-1,150 crore in the near term. Improvement in profitability, leading to improved debt protection metrics, will remain a key monitorable. The ratings also reflect the extensive experience of the promoters in the cotton industry and DNL’s comfortable capital structure. These strengths are partially offset by the vulnerability of operating margin to fluctuations in raw material prices and exposure to demand risks in key operating countries. Key rating drivers and detailed description Strengths: Established position in the cotton industry and strong relationships with customers: The promoter family has been operating the textiles unit since 1989, which has enabled them to understand market dynamics and establish healthy relationships with customers and suppliers. The company exports to China, Bangladesh, Portugal, Mauritius and Singapore, resulting in strong revenue of ~Rs 294 crore in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Revival of demand from the international market resulted in revenue of more than Rs 1,000 crore for the full fiscal 2024. Established market position and healthy clientele will continue to aid the business risk profile over the medium term as well. Comfortable capital structure: The financial risk profile is supported by healthy capital structure, as reflected in low total outstanding liabilities to adjusted networth (TOLANW) ratio of 1.34 times supported by large net worth of Rs 322 crore as on March 31, 2024 (Rs 321.06 crore as on March 31, 2023). The absence of sizeable debt-funded capital expenditure (capex) and expected business revival will enhance the financial risk profile over the medium term. Weaknesses: Vulnerability of operating margin to fluctuations in raw material prices: As cotton is an agricultural commodity, its availability depends on the monsoon. Furthermore, government interventions and fluctuations in global cotton output may result in sharp movement in cotton prices, thereby impacting the profitability of spinning mills. Adverse market conditions will likely result in moderation in the cotton-yarn spread. The operating profitability was 4.6% in fiscal 2024, which has remained in line with that in fiscal 2023. It is expected to improve to 5.5-6% in the near term, driven by improved spread between cotton and cotton yarn. Any further moderation in profitability, leading to weakening of debt protection metrics, will remain a key rating sensitivity factor. Exposure to demand risks: Exports account for around 50% of total sales, majority of which are to Europe, China and Bangladesh. Bangladesh is one of the largest exporters of textiles in the world and any economic disturbance there could adversely affect the business risk profile of DNL. Export contribution to revenue has improved in fiscal 2024, as the lockdown has been lifted in China and the situation in Europe has stabilised, thereby reviving demand. Sustenance of demand from the overseas market will remain monitorable over the medium term. Liquidity: Adequate Bank limit utilisation was moderate at 61% on average for the 12 months through May 2024. Cash accrual is expected to be above Rs 35 crore for fiscal 2025 and above Rs 40 crore for fiscal 2026 against yearly term debt obligation of Rs 12-15 crore over the medium term. The surplus will cushion liquidity. The current ratio was healthy at 1.25 times as on March 31, 2024. Outlook: Stable DNL will continue to benefit from its established market position in the cotton industry, strong relationships with customers and strategic location of the plant. Rating sensitivity factors Upward factors Significant and steady increase in sales volume and operating margin sustained at around 7% Efficient working capital management leading to lower dependence on external debt and improvement in return on capital employed. Downward factors Decline in revenue and operating profitability below 4%, leading to net cash accrual below Rs 22 crore. Stretched working capital cycle or larger-than-expected, debt-funded  capex,  weakening the financial risk profile and liquidity. About the company DNL is a Hissar-based cotton yarn manufacturer with capacity of 158,000 spindles. Its textile unit at Hisar has been operational since 1991. Till March 31, 2019, the unit was part of DCM Ltd, post which it was demerged into DNL through a National Company Law Tribunal order. DNL is listed on the National Stock Exchange and the Bombay Stock Exchange. Mr Hemant Bharat Ram manages daily operations.

Press Release

Long-term / short-term bank facilities Outlook revised from

Details of instruments/facilities in Annexure-1.
Rationale and key rating drivers
CARE Ratings Limited (CARE Ratings) has revised the ratings of Omaxe Limited (OL) from ‘CARE BBB-; Negative/ CARE A3’ to
‘CARE BB+; Stable / CARE A4+’. The downgrade considers various adverse orders. Culmination of all these orders and
announcements leading to adverse outcome will constrain the company’s liquidity. Further, the ratings continue to remain
constrained by project execution and saleability risk for overall development portfolio (ongoing and upcoming projects) and
continued net losses in FY24. The company has high borrowing costs and off-balance sheet exposure, moderately high unsold
inventory in ongoing projects and inherent cyclicality associated with the real estate industry.
However, ratings derive comfort from comfortable operational performance with healthy bookings and collections and comfortable
leverage profile. Ratings continue to factor in extensive experience of the promoter and long track record of development in the
real estate sector.
CARE Ratings notes that the Noida authority has sealed a land parcel of Omaxe Buildhome Private Limited (OBPL) a subsidiary of
OL for pending land dues of ~₹450 crore. There is a dispute regarding the principal and interest amount that is to be paid for
the land dues. OL is in the process of filing an appeal against the land seizure in the competent court, and the outcome will be
closely monitored.
Rating sensitivities at consolidated group level: Factors likely to lead to rating actions
Positive factors
• Significant increase in size of project portfolio with maintenance of committed receivable coverage ratio over 80% while
maintaining unsold inventory levels below 18 months, on sustained basis.
• Outcomes of various adverse orders, not impacting the liquidity and financial risk profile of the company.
Negative factors
• Deterioration in the committed receivable coverage ratio below 50%, on sustained basis.
• Significant decline in collections and resultant increase in funding from debt to total project cost over 40%, on sustained
basis
• Unfavourable outcome of the various orders post representation to competent authorities, adversely impacting the financial
profile of the company.
Analytical approach: Consolidated
CARE Ratings has taken a consolidated approach for analysing Omaxe Limited, which has 117 subsidiaries/ step-subsidiaries/
associates (hereafter referred as OL group), which are primarily land holding companies. The details are listed in Annexure-6.
Outlook: Stable
The “Stable” outlook reflects that the OL group is likely to sustain its comfortable cash flow position against project and debt
commitments, supported by the presence of satisfactory committed receivables in ongoing projects.

obligation, with the potential financial liability of over ₹100 crore, unenvisaged by CARE Ratings. The large portion of this liability
is deposited in ESCROW account for this project. OL is in process of filing an appeal against the award in the competent court,
and the outcome will be closely monitored.
On July 30, 2024, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) passed an order indicating findings of misstatements and
irregularities in company’s financial statements. SEBI imposes a penalty on OL and its directors. The adverse findings on
accounting and governance practices may impact the group’s access to capital, both debt and equity, which in turn, may impair
the financial flexibility of the group. The company has appealed against this order, and the outcome will be closely monitored.
On August 08, 2024, OL received IT demand notice of ₹298.31 crore for previous assessment years. OL has appealed against this
IT demand notice and has deposited ~₹ 15 crores. The company has appealed against this order, and the outcome of the same
will be monitorable.
On September 07, 2024, the Noida Authority has sealed a land parcel demanding overall land dues of ~₹ 450 crore. The company
is in process to file an appeal in competent court and the outcome will be closely monitored.
Sizeable future expansion plans to elevate execution risk
Over next two years, the group has plans to launch new projects with overall project cost of ₹8,000 crore. While, these projects
will be executed in phases, it is likely to elevate execution and saleability risk. Accordingly, launching these projects and overall
sales momentum in these projects will remain monitorable.
Among projects in pipeline, the OL group is launching a major project, where it is required to build and operate multi sports
facility stadium in Delhi’s Dwarka area, under Design, Build Finance, Operate and Transfer (DBFOT) model with DDA (Delhi
Development Authority). Expected project cost of the stadium is around ₹1,500 crore. Under this project, the group will be entitled
to monetise commercial/retail portion of 7 lsf, which is likely to generate revenue of over ₹4,500 crore. Given that the project is
capital intensive, the company may avail additional debt, impacting its leverage position. Accordingly, maintaining comfortable
leverage position will remain monitorable.
Moderate unsold inventory
As on March 31, 2024, the area of unsold units of the group stood at 4.23 msf with potential value of over ₹5,000 crore. Based
on the area sold in FY24, the group is maintaining moderate unsold inventory of close to two years.
Continuous net losses
OL has posted net losses in previous four fiscals. The group recognises revenue upon transfer of possessions. The revenue
recognition in previous four fiscals has been lower as compared to the cost incurred in respective years. Currently, the group has
been recognising revenue of projects that were launched prior to pandemic and owing to delays in some projects expenditure
also includes cost overrun. However, as Omaxe chowk, having a revenue potential of over ₹2,500 crore, is now ready for
possession, a major portion of revenue from the projected sale is expected to be recognised in FY25, which shall remain
monitorable.
High cost of borrowing and off-balance sheet exposure
The group’s debt to fund ongoing projects constitutes high cost of borrowing ranging ~14%-15%. The group has been
undertaking efforts to reduce cost of borrowing, which shall remain monitorable. Additionally, as on March 31, 2024, the company
has sizeable off-balance sheet exposure of ₹685.61 crore (including tax dispute of ₹351.29 crore). Adverse impacts on the
company’s financial risk profile due to crystallisation of contingent liabilities, will remain key monitorable.
Inherent cyclical nature of real estate industry
The group is exposed to cyclicality associated with the real estate sector, which has direct linkage with the general macro-
economic scenario, interest rates and level of disposable income available with individuals. In case of real estate companies,
profitability highly depends on property markets. A high interest rate scenario could discourage consumers from borrowing to
finance real estate purchases and might depress the real estate market. OL group’s portfolio is spread across tier-I and tier-II
cities in Haryana, Punjab, and NCR. Although there is stable demand currently, adverse impact in these micro-markets will remain
monitorable.
Key strengths
Experienced promoters with long track record in real estate sector
OL derives strength from experience of promoters, Rohtas Goel (Chairman) and Mohit Goel (Managing Director), with over two
decades of experience in construction and real estate development. The promoter group held 74.14% stake in OL as on March
31, 2024. The group has a track record of successful completion of real estate projects, including development of township, group
housing, and commercial complexes, among others. As on March 31, 2024, it has a track record of executing over 131 msf as a
real estate developer and as third-party contractor.

Press Release
Healthy booking status and satisfactory receivable coverage ratio
As on March 31, 2024 the OL group sold around 49 msf of launched area of around 53 msf. The booking ratio stood healthy at
92% as on March 31, 2024, in line with booking status of over 90% in the last two fiscals.
Among ongoing projects, the committed receivables stood comfortable at over ₹2,800 crore as on March 31, 2024, which covers
over 65% balance project cost and outstanding debt. Owing to phase-wise launches, the committed receivable coverage ratio
stood comfortable in the last three fiscals between 65% and 75%.
Advanced stage of completion of development portfolio
Currently, the OL group has 20 ongoing projects, which are largely in advanced stages of completion. As on March 31, 2024, the
total project cost is over ₹13,000 crore, with around 75% of cost stands incurred, indicating limited execution risk towards ongoing
projects. Construction progress has witnessed gradual improvement in the last two years. Of the 20 projects, 12 projects are in
advanced stage with more than 70% cost incurred and balance eight projects are in intermediate stage, with 40-70% of cost
incurred.
Improving pre-bookings collections and low reliance on debt
Owing to healthy demand, the group has witnessed improvement in its operating performance and leverage position. In FY24,
the company sold 3.11 million-sq-ft (msf) of area, with booking value of over ₹1,800 crore. The group has collected ₹2,335 crore
in FY24, slightly improved from ₹2,282 crore in FY23 and consequently the debt level (including non-fund-based utilisation) has
reduced from ₹1,007 crore as on March 31, 2023 to ₹806 crore as on March 31, 2024. The company’s comfortable debt position
is also reflected from the ratio of debt/total project cost, which stood between 8% and 15% in past three fiscals.
Liquidity: Adequate
As on June 30, 2024, OL had maintained free liquid investments of close to ₹550 crore against scheduled debt commitments
(including interest) of close to ₹337 crore in next four quarters. The group’s cash flow position is comfortable as it has adequate
committed receivables, which covers over 67% of balance project cost and outstanding debt. Due to low debt position and
repayments in the near term, the company’s cash coverage ratio (CCR) is also comfortable in the projected years. The
compensation awarded in favour of PDA is likely to result in cash outflow of over ₹100 crore. Additionally, cash outflow of another
₹100 crore is likely, when the company appeals against the land seizure by the Noida Authority.
Assumptions/Covenants: Not applicable
Environment, social, and governance (ESG) risks
CARE Ratings believes that OL’s ESG profile supports its credit risk profile. The sector’s social impact is characterised by health
hazards, leading to a higher focus on labour safety and well-being, given the nature of its operations. The Omaxe group has
continuously focused on mitigating its environmental and social risks. Key highlights of the ESG initiatives are as follows:
• The company is designing and upgrading environment-friendly buildings and its contractors are attempting to provide
hygienic and healthy working environment to workers at construction sites, including training to improve capabilities of
the local work force.
• The company implements building structure designs that are safer than mandatorily required under the requisite building
code.
• The company disposes some of the construction waste as scrap to get it recycled and re-use it in construction works.
The company has deployed sewage treatment plants at its projects and construction sites, which treat and recycle
wastewater for reusing in watering plants, and toilets, among others.
• There are no anti-competitive, abuse of dominant position or unfair trade practices cases pending against the company.

Rating Rationale
Acuité has reaffirmed the long-term rating of 'ACUITE A-' (read as ACUITE A minus) on the Rs. 400.00 crore
bank facilities of C S L Finance Limited (CSL). The outlook is 'Stable'.
Acuité has assigned the long-term rating of 'ACUITE A-' (read as ACUITE A minus) on the Rs. 200.00 crore
bank facilities of C S L Finance Limited (CSL). The outlook is 'Stable'.
Rationale for the rating
The rating assigned factors in sustained increase in scale of operations, adequate capitalization level, healthy
profitability metrics and improving asset quality. The growth in portfolio is owing to the improvement in
disbursements in FY24. The AUM grew to Rs. 1,065 Cr. as on June 30, 2024 from 1030.67 Cr. as on March 31,
2024 (Rs. 735.61 Cr. as on March 31, 2023). The disbursements for FY24 were to the tune of Rs. 1,052 Cr. (P.Y:
Rs. 756.83 Cr.) CSL’s CAR stood at 51.18 percent with Tier 1 capital of 50.75 percent as of Mar 31, 2024. The
profitability saw an improvement YoY as marked by increase in Total Income (net of interest expense) from Rs.
90.35 Cr. in FY23 to Rs. 123.65 Cr. in FY24. The PAT for Q1 FY25 stood at Rs. 18.49 Cr. as compared to 63.36
Cr. for FY24 (P.Y: Rs. 45.63 Cr.). While Acuite takes cognizance of asset quality challenges in the real estate and
SME sector, CSL has been able to maintain comfortable asset quality as marked by its on-time portfolio, which
stood at 97.88 percent with a GNPA of 0.45 percent and NNPA of 0.26 percent as of March 31, 2024. The gearing
remains comfortable at 1.10 times as on June 30, 2024 as compared to 1.06 times as on March 31, 2024.
The rating is however, constrained by geographical concentration and major wholesale book exposure in its loan
portfolio but is well managed as the company has expertise and thorough knowledge which it has gained in its long
run. The concentration in its wholesale book has been brought down from 81 percent to 54 percent in the last 3
years and the company is expecting to bring this concentration to 40 percent in the coming year. The rating is
further constrained by the low seasoning of the small and medium enterprise (SME) portfolio. These constraints
weigh on the credit profile of the company. Going forward, movement in asset quality, profitability metrics and
any deterioration in capital structure or capitalization levels will be key credit indicators.
About the company

on 28th December 1992. The company is a Non-Banking Finance Company registered with the Reserve Bank of
India and listed on both the Stock Exchanges. The Company is a one-stop destination for Small and Medium-Sized

Analytical Approach
Acuité has adopted a standalone approach on CSL’s business and financial risk profile for arriving at the rating.
Key Rating Drivers
Strength
Acuité Ratings & Research Limited www.acuite.in
Comfortable capitalisation with a diversified funding mix
CSL’s net worth improved owing to internal accruals and equity infusion received from Kitara Capital of Rs 48 Cr.
in FY2024 to Rs. 474.83 crore as of Mar 31, 2024 from Rs 362.52 crore in FY2023. It reported an adequate
capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 51.18 percent, comprising Tier 1 capital at 50.75 percent. The gearing remains
comfortable at 1.10 times as on Jun 30, 2024 as compared to 1.06 times as on Mar 31, 2024. The company has a
diverse lender profile, comprising banks, both private and public and financial institution, CSL has been able to
obtain disbursements of Rs 372.41 crore for FY2024 in the form of term loans. CSL’s average cost of funds
ranges between 11 to 12 percent.
Acuité believes, going forward, that the ability of the company to mobilise low-cost funding through debt and its
ability to deploy the funds profitably will be key factors to monitor.
Healthy profitability metrics
The profitability saw an improvement YoY as marked by increase in Total Income (net of interest expense) from
Rs. 90.35 Cr. in FY23 to Rs. 123.60 Cr. in FY24. The PAT for Q1 FY25 stood at Rs. 18.49 Cr. as compared to Rs.
63.36 Cr. for FY24 (P.Y: Rs. 45.63 Cr.). Despite the company being in an expansion phase, its operating
expense to earning assets moderated to 3.62 percent in FY2024 as against 3.76 percent in FY2023. Resulting in an
increase in its ROAA to 7.19 percent in FY2024 from 6.97 percent in FY2023. CSL has also shown strong control
over its credit costs as the asset quality has shown improvement with lower slippages and increased recoveries.
Acuité believes, going forward, the company will be able to maintain healthy profitability metrics given that it’s
asset quality and credit costs are contained.
Improved asset quality
The company’s asset quality is marked by on time portfolio of 97.88 percent as on Mar 31, 2024 as against 98.36
percent as on Mar 31, 2023. CLS’s asset quality improved from 0.61 percent GNPA and 0.35 percent NNPA in
FY23 to 0.45 percent GNPA and 0.26 percent in FY24 with comfortable PCR of 42.59 percent. The prudent
underwriting policies adopted by the management and improving collection efficiency has enabled the company to
improve its asset quality.
Acuité believes that going forward the ability of the company to maintain comfortable asset quality and growth
momentum in AUM will be key rating sensitivity.
Weakness
Low seasoning of SME portfolio and concentration risk.
CSL forayed into the lending segment in 2011, but has commenced extending loans to SME since 2017, with an
average tenure from 5 to 7 years. The company’s retail loan book has grown significantly to Rs. 440.93 crore as of
Mar 31, 2024, from Rs. 291.57 crore as of Mar 31, 2023 constituting 46 percent of the total book. As the tenure
is high the seasoning of this segment is yet to be established. CSL’s portfolio is majorly exposed towards its real
estate segment, with 54% as on Mar 31, 2024, though, it has come down gradually from 81% as on March 31,
2021. Further, company is expecting to achieve the product mix of 60:40 between retail and wholesale segment in
the next 12 to 18 months. CSL’s book is concentrated to its top 20 borrowers account which form ~29% of total
AUM and slippages from these large accounts can put pressure on the asset quality, leading to higher
delinquencies. Further, the company’s operations are concentrated in Delhi-NCR region.
Rating Sensitivity
Movement in gearing levels
Timely infusion of capital
Movement in profitability metrics
Changes in regulatory environment
Liquidity Position
Adequate
CSL’s overall liquidity profile remains adequate. The company’s assets and liabilities are well matched with no
deficit in any of the time buckets upto 5 years as on Sept 30, 2023. CSL has maintained cash and cash equivalents
of Rs. 63.39 Cr. as on Mar 31, 2024.

Note on complexity levels of the rated instrument
In order to inform the investors about complexity of instruments, Acuité has categorized such instruments in three
levels: Simple, Complex and Highly Complex. Acuite’s categorisation of the instruments across the three
categories is based on factors like variability of the returns to the investors, uncertainty in cash flow patterns,
number of counterparties and general understanding of the instrument by the market. It has to be understood that
complexity is different from credit risk and even an instrument categorized as 'Simple' can carry high levels of
risk. For more details, please refer Rating Criteria “Complexity Level Of Financial Instruments” on www.acuite.in.

Emkay Global Financial Services Limited: [ICRA]BBB+ (Positive) assigned to NCD
programme; short-term rating reaffirmed
Summary of rating action
Previous Rated Amount Current Rated Amount
Instrument* Rating Action
(Rs. crore) (Rs. crore)
Non-convertible debenture programme - 100.0 [ICRA]BBB+ (Positive); assigned
Short-term non-fund based bank lines 250.0 250.0 [ICRA]A2+; reaffirmed
Total 250.0 350.0
*Instrument details are provided in Annexure I
Rationale
The assigned rating factors in Emkay Global Financial Services Limited’s (Emkay) established market position and track record
of over two and a half decades in the capital markets, with a focus on the institutional segment, and the adequate capitalisation
for the current scale of operations. The company’s financial profile remains characterised by low dependence on fund-based
borrowings, while the liquidity position is adequate.
The credit profile is, however, constrained by the company’s modest scale of operations and its exposure to the inherently
volatile capital markets, besides high dependence on technology and the evolving regulatory environment. ICRA also notes
that Emkay’s core operating performance has been constrained by the elevated cost structure over the years. Nonetheless,
the company reported an improvement in its core operating performance in recent periods, driven by the increase in broking
revenue and fee income from merchant banking deals amid industry tailwinds. Supported by gains from proprietary
trading/investments, Emkay reported a net profit of Rs. 31 crore, profit after tax (PAT)/net operating income (NOI) of 12% and
return on equity (RoE) of 14% in FY2024 compared to Rs. 14 crore, 9% and 7%, respectively, in FY2023. The profitability
trajectory continued in Q1 FY2025 with a net profit of Rs. 14 crore, PAT/NOI of 18% and RoE of 23% on a provisional basis.
Going forward, the company’s ability to improve the profitability of its core operations on a sustained basis will remain
imperative from a credit perspective.
The Positive outlook on the long-term rating factors in the improving trajectory of Emkay's financial performance, aided by the
scale-up in the broking & non-broking businesses amid industry tailwinds. While its revenues will remain exposed to the
inherent volatility in capital markets and the evolving regulatory environment, the traction in wealth /asset management and
distribution businesses is likely to provide some stability to the company’s revenue and profitability profile.
Key rating drivers and their description
Credit strengths
Long track record in capital market related business with focus on institutional broking – Emkay has a track record of over
two and a half decades in capital markets with a presence in equity, currency and commodity broking along with lending,
investment banking, alternative assets and wealth management services. With more than 300 institutional clients, Emkay is
an institutional-focused brokerage house, deriving over 50% of its NOI from this segment.
Adequate capitalisation for current scale of operations – Emkay’s capitalisation profile is characterised by minimal
dependence on fund-based borrowings with a net worth of ~Rs. 255 crore, on a provisional basis, as of June 30, 2024. The
reported financial leverage remains negligible with a gearing of less than 0.1 times over the years. The company primarily
avails fund-based borrowings for supporting the loan book in the lending business and working capital requirements in the
broking business. In addition to fund-based borrowings, it avails bank guarantee limits for meeting the margin requirements
www.icra .in 1
Page |
of the broking operations at the exchange houses. The proceeds of the proposed non-convertible debentures are expected to
be used towards working capital requirements in the broking operations. With the increase in working capital requirements,
Emkay is expected to witness a further rise in borrowings, though the capitalisation profile is expected to remain adequate.
Improved profitability amid industry tailwinds, though cost structure remains elevated – Driven by the increase in broking
income and fee income from merchant banking deals amid industry tailwinds, Emkay reported an improvement in its core
operating performance in FY2024 with an operating profit of Rs. 20 crore compared to losses in the past two fiscals.
Additionally, income/gains from the proprietary trading/investment book boosted its headline profit. Emkay reported a net
profit of Rs. 31 crore, PAT/NOI of 12% and RoE of 14% in FY2024 compared to Rs. 14 crore, 9% and 7%, respectively, in FY2023.
With buoyant market conditions, the profitability trajectory continued in Q1 FY2025 with a net profit of Rs. 14 crore, PAT/NOI
of 18% and RoE of 23% on a provisional basis, though the sustainability of the same across market cycles remains to be seen.
Further, notwithstanding the recent improvement in profitability, the cost structure remains elevated with a cost-to-income
ratio of more than 80%, given the sizeable employee-related expenses in the merchant banking and institutional equities
businesses.
Credit challenges
Moderate scale of broking business – While Emkay has registered a robust increase in the average daily turnover (ADTO) in
the equity broking business in recent periods on account of significant broking contribution from high frequency trading and
direct market access arrangements, the scale of the broking business, in terms of revenues, remains limited. This is due to the
flattish/low-yielding nature of the products/arrangements. Further, the diversification of the revenue profile remains limited
with fee income from broking and advisory services accounting for over 70% of the net operating income.
Exposure to inherently volatile capital markets – Emkay’s primary revenue stream remains exposed to the inherently volatile
capital markets with 73% of the NOI arising from broking and advisory-related income. Further, it earns carry income in the
asset management business, where it has deployed ~8-10% of its net worth as sponsor commitments for its alternative
investment funds. Thus, the possibility of pressure on profitability, especially during downturns, cannot be ruled out.
Elevated competition, high dependence on technology, and evolving regulatory environment – Securities broking companies
rely heavily on technology for trade execution, fund management, etc. Thus, technical failures or disruptions pose operational
and reputation risk. Moreover, given the highly regulated nature of the industry, brokerage houses remain exposed to
regulatory risk. Their ability to ensure compliance with the evolving regulatory landscape remains crucial. As the sector also
remains characterised by intense competition with susceptibility to the entry of new players, pressure on pricing cannot be
ruled out. Additionally, regulatory changes such as higher margin requirements, uniform charges to be levied by market
infrastructure institutions, and measures to be implemented for the strengthening of the index derivatives framework, could
impact the profitability of the broking industry. Nevertheless, given the sizeable share of revenues from the institutional
segment, the impact on Emkay could be relatively lower.
Environmental and social risks
While financial institutions do not face any material physical climate risks, they are exposed to environmental risks indirectly
through their portfolio of assets. Nonetheless, such risk is not material for the Group as its lending operations are primarily
focused on capital market-related lending. Further, the business activities are typically short-to-medium term in nature, which
will allow it to adapt if required.
With regard to social risks, data security and customer privacy are among the key sources of vulnerability for financial
institutions as material lapses could be detrimental to their reputation and invite regulatory censure. Emkay did not witness
any technical glitches in FY2024. Going forward, its ability to offer uninterrupted services will be imperative for maintaining
customer experience. It is noted that customer preference is increasingly shifting towards the digital mode of transacting,
www.icra .in 2
Page |
necessitating the adoption of technological advancements, besides providing an opportunity to reduce the operating costs.
The Group has been making investments to enhance its digital interface with its customers.
Liquidity position: Adequate
Emkay’s liquidity requirement is primarily for placing margins at the exchanges. During February 2024 to August 2024, the
average cash and equivalent margin placed (including unallocated across segments) at the exchanges (basis month-end data,
including client margin) stood at Rs. 880 crore with average utilisation of 22%. The liquidity profile is adequate with an
unencumbered cash and bank balance of ~Rs. 7 crore and unutilised but drawable fund-based limits of ~Rs. 17 crore against
nil external fund-based borrowings as of August 31, 2024. Additionally, it avails an intraday loan facility of ~Rs. 295 crore, which
supports the working capital requirements of the broking operations. These intraday lines are backed by fixed deposits and
fixed assets.

Details of instruments/facilities in Annexure-1.
@ The above ratings are proposed to be backed by unconditional and irrevocable corporate guarantees from HCL Corporation Pvt Ltd.
Unsupported rating CARE BBB+ / CARE A2 [Reaffirmed]
Note: Unsupported rating does not factor in the explicit credit enhancement.
Rationale and key rating drivers for credit enhanced debt
The provisional rating assigned to bank facilities at (II) above on September 20, 2023, has been converted to ‘Final’ on submission
of the executed corporate guarantee (CG) deed.
CARE Ratings Limited (CARE Ratings) has reaffirmed both standalone ratings (I) and credit-enhanced ratings (II) to bank facilities
of HCL Infosystems Limited (HCLI). The credit-enhanced ratings assigned to bank facilities of HCLI factor in the credit
enhancement (CE) in the form of unconditional and irrevocable CG from HCL Corporation Private Limited (HCLC). The credit-
enhanced ratings are based on CARE Ratings’ view on the CE provider’s credit profile. The rating rationale highlights the key
credit risk assessment parameters of both, the CE provider and the standalone ratings.
Rationale and key rating drivers of HCLC
Reaffirmation of the credit-enhanced ratings continues to reflect the robust financial flexibility of HCLC emanating from the
significant mark-to-market valuation of its equity investments in group companies, HCL Technologies Limited (HCLT) and other
liquid investments, which have led to adequate coverage in terms of the mark-to-market value of investments to outstanding
debt, both on-balance and off-balance sheet of HCLC. These investments generate steady dividend income. The holding company
also derives significant benefits from experienced promoters and their resourcefulness. HCLC’s strength is amplified further by it
holding the ‘HCL’ brand.
However, these rating strengths are constrained by the investment’s exposures to fluctuations in capital market and the absence
of a significant stake of a strong underlying entity among its key investments.
Key rating drivers of HCLI
The standalone ratings of HCLI continue to factor in its strong linkages with the resourceful HCL group and the strong track record
of financial support from its promoter group through HCLC in the form of interest-free unsecured loans and CG towards its
outstanding working capital facilities.
However, these strengths are tempered by the operating losses incurred over the years and the resultant scaling-down of
operations and the weak financial risk profile at a standalone level.
Rating sensitivities of corporate guarantor – HCLC: Factors likely to lead to rating actions
Positive factor
• Addition of a strong underlying entity providing consistent cash flows, leading to a substantial rise in the value of the
investment portfolio, leading to strengthening of the market value of investments-to-debt ratio.
Negative factors
• Decline in value of its investment portfolio and/or rise in debt either on-balance sheet or off-balance sheet, leading to
moderation of the market value of investments-to-debt ratio of below 4.5x.
• Transfer of the ‘HCL’ brand to another entity.
1Complete definition of the ratings assigned are available at www.careedge.in and other CARE Ratings Ltd.’s publications
1 CARE Ratings Ltd.
Press Release
Rating sensitivities of standalone rating of HCLI: Factors likely to lead to rating actions
Positive factors
• Undertaking significant new projects, leading to profitable revenue growth.
• Significant equity infusion, leading to a healthy net worth.
Negative factors
• Weakening of the linkages with its promoter group, HCLC and/or VAMA Sundari Investments (Delhi) Private Limited (VAMA).
• Deterioration in financial flexibility of HCLC to provide further support to HCLI.
Analytical approach of HCLI:
Standalone and Unsupported ratings: Consolidated
CARE Ratings takes a consolidated view of HCLI and its subsidiaries owing to the significant business, operational, and financial
linkages between the parent and the subsidiaries. The details of subsidiaries and associates that have been consolidated, as on
March 31, 2024, are given in Annexure-6.
Credit-enhanced ratings: Backed by CG by HCLC
The bank facilities to be availed by HCLI are backed by a CG from HCLC. Hence, to arrive at ratings, CARE Ratings has assessed
HCLC’s standalone financial risk profile.
Analytical approach of CE provider i.e. HCLC: Standalone
Outlook: Stable
CARE Ratings believes that HCLC is expected to maintain its healthy market value of investments-to-debt ratio of at least 6x over
the medium term and remain a key holding company in the HCL group, considering it houses the ‘HCL’ brand.
HCLI is also expected to continue to receive support from the HCL group to service its operational and financial obligations.
Detailed description of key rating drivers
Key strengths
Strong and resourceful promoter group with a long track record of operations
HCLC is one of the holding companies of the HCL group, which was founded in 1980, and is promoted by Shiv Nadar and his
family. HCLI is also an HCL group company. Shiv Nadar is the Founder and Chairman of the HCL group and the Shiv Nadar
Foundation. He founded HCL in 1976 and has wide entrepreneurship experience (nearly 50 years) in the Information Technology
(IT) sector. In 2008, he was awarded the Padma Bhushan for his efforts in the development of the IT industry in India. In 2007,
Madras University awarded him an honorary Doctorate degree. He was also recognized as the E&Y Entrepreneur of the Year 2007
and has received several awards for his association with the IT sector. HCLC’s and HCLI’s day-to-day operations are managed by
a team of qualified and experienced management, spearheaded by promoters having vast experience in the IT business. The
group has established a reputable image and brand name over the years.
The promoters house their investments in IT, healthcare, and talent management solutions through investment companies, VAMA
and HCLC. HCLT (market capitalisation of ₹4.30 lakh crore as on August 12, 2024), the flagship company of the group, has
60.81% promoter shareholding, which includes 44.17% by VAMA and 0.17% by HCLC.
Healthy financial risk profile with a strong net worth base and healthy asset profile of HCLC
HCLC has a strong capital structure with a healthy net worth base of ₹4,863 crore (standalone) as on March 31, 2024. It has an
almost unleveraged balance sheet, with only major debt obligations being the guaranteed debt for its associates. HCLC has
marketable investments of around ₹2,818 crore as on June 30, 2024. The off-balance sheet debt, i.e. CG towards HCLI bank
guarantees, stood at ₹331 crore as on the same date, leading to an investment value by debt of 8.52x. However, HCLC provided
additional CG of ₹65 crore towards new bank guarantee facilities taken by HCLI leading to moderation in the investment value to
debt ratio of 7.11x (considering investment value of June 30, 2024). The company is expected to maintain at least a market value
investment-to-debt cover of 6x. HCLC houses the brand ‘HCL’ in its book, which holds significant value to the HCL group.
Track record of financial support by HCLC to HCLI
In light of the losses incurred by HCLI, the support from the HCL group, particularly HCLC, gives significant comfort. HCLC has
infused interest-free unsecured loans of ₹355 crore (outstanding as on March 31, 2024) in HCLI. Furthermore, HCLC provides
unconditional and irrevocable CG to HCLI’s working capital facilities, which is around ₹396 crore as on August 15, 2024.
HCLC has internal approvals to grant financial support to HCLI, either in the form of a CG or unsecured loans, for up to ₹1,500
crore. The total support extended is ₹751 crore as on August 15, 2024. Considering the continuous losses, HCLC’s financial
support is key to the company being a going concern entity.
2 CARE Ratings Ltd.
Press Release
Key weaknesses
Exposure to fluctuations in capital markets
Financial flexibility in terms of the value of marketable investments to debt of HCLC is exposed to the prevailing market sentiments
and the share prices. Any increase in the market-related risks, leading to a sharp fall in the share prices of investments, will be a
key rating sensitivity factor.
Continued PBILDT losses, leading to HCLI’s weak financial risk profile
HCLI has been continuously making profit before interest, lease rentals, depreciation and taxation (PBILDT) losses considering
historical low-margin contracts and delayed receivables, significant portion of which has been written-off, and high legal costs for
the large litigations being undertaken to recover these receivables. The company has negative net worth of about ₹270 crore as
on March 31, 2024. Gradually, the company has shut down all its segments, except the system integration (SI) business. The
management has completed projects of the SI business and only the annual maintenance contracts are pending, which need to
be honoured. No new business is expected to be received. The continued losses have fully eroded the net worth and the company
is able to sustain itself considering the significant financial support received from HCLC.
HCLC’s financial profile is moderated, considering the modest valuation of HCLI due to these losses.
Liquidity
HCLI: Adequate
The company is operating at cash losses, but there is no term loan or fund-based working capital loan outstanding as on date.
Currently, only bank guarantee obligations are outstanding against projects undertaken by HCLI. Amid these cash losses, the
liquidity support is largely derived from the authorised limit of funding support from HCLC amounting to ₹1,500 crore in the form
of CG/Unsecured loans. The company has ₹175 crore of cash and cash equivalents as on June 30, 2024, of which about ₹68 crore
was kept as margin money. The company also has liquid investments of ₹31 crore as on June 30, 2024. However, the comfort of
cash & cash equivalents and liquid investments is negated considering ongoing arbitration with MTNL wherein MTNL has provided
around ₹120 crore as cash deposit until the arbitration is completed. HCLI has made provision for the same.
HCLC: Strong
HCLC has healthy investment portfolio amounting ₹2,783 crore as on March 31, 2024 and ₹2,818 crore as on June 30, 2024.
Against this, the company has guaranteed debt of ₹396 crore as on August 15, 2024 for its group companies, mainly HCLI. The
company has steady flow of interest and dividend income from its investment.

in by the partners/proprietors in addition to the financial performance and other relevant factors. CARE Ratings is not responsible for any errors and states that it has
no financial liability whatsoever to the users of the ratings of CARE Ratings. The ratings of CARE Ratings do not factor in any rating-related trigger clauses as per the
terms of the facilities/instruments, which may involve acceleration of payments in case of rating downgrades. However, if any such clauses are introduced and
triggered, the ratings may see volatility and sharp downgrades.

Details of instruments/facilities in Annexure-1.
*Issuer did not cooperate; based on best available information.
Rationale and key rating drivers
CARE Ratings Ltd. had, vide its press release dated December 28, 2023, placed the rating(s) of Sadbhav Infrastructure Projects
Limited (SIPL) under the ‘issuer non-cooperating’ category as SIPL had failed to provide information for monitoring of the rating
as agreed to in its Rating Agreement. SIPL continues to be non-cooperative despite repeated requests for submission of
information through e-mails dated November 12, 2024, November 22, 2024, and December 02, 2024 among others. In line with
the extant SEBI guidelines, CARE Ratings Ltd. has reviewed the rating on the basis of the best available information which
however, in CARE Ratings Ltd.’s opinion is not sufficient to arrive at a fair rating.
Users of this rating (including investors, lenders and the public at large) are hence requested to exercise caution
while using the above rating(s).
The ratings have been revised on account of non-availability of information pertaining to conclusion of stake sale, realisation of
stake sale proceeds and utilisation of the same along with status of project progress in its hybrid annuity model (HAM) projects,
which have previously been delayed for various reasons. Notwithstanding the extension of time (EOT) granted by authority, delay
in completion of these projects beyond agreed upon timelines, exposes company to performance risk thereby attracting levy of
damages etc. The rating also factors issuance of notice of termination of concession agreement (CA) by two if its subsidiaries-
Rohtak Panipat Tollway Private Limited (RPTPL) and Rohtak Hissar Tollways Private Limited (RHTPL) to National Highways
Authority of India (NHAI; rated CARE AAA; Stable) on account of Force Majeure Event. Inordinate delays in projects execution
are expected to deteriorate financial performance of the company in the medium term.
Furthermore, the liquidity of Sadbhav group continued to remain stretched given inordinate delay in materialization of various
fund-raising plans and elongated gross current asset days.
Nevertheless, rating continues to derive strength from the established track record of the Sadbhav group in construction segment
along with favourable prospects of road sectors amidst surge in competitive industry.
Analytical approach: Combined
CARE has taken a combined view of SEL (standalone) and SIPL (standalone) for analytical purpose. This is because majority of
the long-term debt raised in SIPL is backed by unconditional and irrevocable corporate guarantee of SEL. Further, SEL and SIPL
have operational and financial linkages for funding investment in new projects, bridging of shortfall in select SPVs as well as
upstreaming of cash flow of SPVs
Outlook: Stable
Detailed description of key rating drivers
At the time of last rating on December 28, 2023, the following were the rating strengths and weaknesses:
Key weaknesses
Sustained delay in the execution of various HAM projects
As against the expectation of gradual ramp-up in the pace of execution, it continued to remain slow leading to delay in all its on-
going HAM projects. The physical progress of works as on March 31, 2022, in respect of Sadbhav Vidarbha Highway Private
Limited (SVHPL), Sadbhav Kim Expressway Private Limited (SKEPL) and Sadbhav Nainital Highway Private Limited (SNHPL)
continued to remain delayed. In addition, NHAI has also issued notice of intention to terminate CA in one of the HAM projects-
1Complete definition of ratings assigned are available at www.careedge.in and other CARE Ratings Limited’s publications.
1 CARE Ratings Ltd.
Press Release
SBHPL due to delay in completion of work beyond EOT. Furthermore, two if its subsidiaries- Rohtak Panipat Tollway Private
Limited (RPTPL) and Rohtak Hissar Tollways Private Limited (RHTPL)have issued notice of termination of concession agreement
(CA) to National Highways Authority of India (NHAI; rated CARE AAA; Stable) on account of Force Majeure Event. Inordinate
delay in project execution along with curing such delays beyond permitted extension of time (EOT) heightens risk related to levy
of damages by authority as per contractual terms which is further expected to deteriorate the credit profile as well as financial
performance of the group.
Inordinate delay in receipt of various stake sale proceeds
During past review, materialization of various fund- raising plans including ARRIL, MBCNL and stake sale in various operational
HAM projects was envisaged to improve the liquidity position of the group. The stake sale transaction in ARRIL was expected to
be concluded by Q4FY22. However, the same is still awaited despite receipt of NOC from Authority during November 2020. As
indicated by the management, ARRIL has received cash inflow of around Rs.98 crore during Q1FY23 towards payment
compensation of exempted cars from the authority, majority of which have been used towards working capital requirements.
Sadbhav group had also entered into stake sale agreement with Adani group for sale of its entire stake in MBCNL and the part
proceeds from the same were envisaged to be received by October 2021. Management indicated receipt of part tranche of Rs.290
crore during Q4FY22 while balance tranche of Rs.260 crore was envisaged post receipt of approval from Government of
Maharashtra (GoM) and completion of balance residual work by Q2FY23. Latest information on the deals is not available.
Key Strengths
Established track record of the Sadbhav group in Indian construction sector
Sadbhav Group has a track record of over two decades in the Indian road construction sector. SEL has successfully completed
construction of more than 8,400 lane km of road projects since its establishment.
Thrust of government on infrastructure development
Continued government thrust on the road construction sector augurs well for SIPL’s growth prospects in the medium term. Under
the government’s National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP), a substantial outlay on road construction – ~18% of the overall ₹111
trillion plan – is expected to provide the necessary impetus to companies operating in this segment. Railway station redevelopment
projects aim to redevelop 400 railway station across India at ₹1 lakh crore through the Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode.
The power sector is poised for growth, driven by continuous affordable power, higher electric mobility envisaged to be supplied
through rapid addition in renewable capacity, and storage. This is likely to provide adequate growth opportunities in inter-state
transmission, intra-state transmission, and cross border transmission. Increased focus of GOI on overall Infrastructure
development is expected to benefit players such as SIPL, given its strong execution track record.
Liquidity: Stretched
Gross current asset days elongated to 637 days during FY21 owing large proportion of receivables for ongoing HAM projects.
Stretched current assets levels, sustained delay in scaling up of operations owing to large proportion of slow-moving order book
and cost overrun in ongoing HAM projects are the prominent reasons for the stretched liquidity. Liquidity position was earlier
expected to ease out gradually with improvement in the pace of execution and receipt of large cash inflow of around Rs.1100
crore in H1FY22 to shore up liquidity. Nevertheless, the liquidity of the group continued to remain stretched indicating no
meaningful improvement in the gross current asset days. Utilization of the fund based working capital limits for the trailing twelve
months ended April 2022 stood high. Liquidity is expected to remain weak given execution delays and in ordinate delay in
materialization of various fund-raising plans.

The ratings remain constrained by the company’s small scale of operations, modest EBITDA margins and credit metrics, and stretched liquidity. Although, Ind-Ra expects the scale of operations and EBITDA margins to improve in FY26. The ratings remain supported by promoters’ more than three decades of experience in the media industry.List of Key Rating DriversWeaknesses - Decline in EBITDA margins - Deterioration in credit metrics - Continued small scale of operations - Competitive industry; dependence on advertisement revenueStrengths- Experienced promoters- Established distribution and client networkDetailed Description of Key Rating DriversDecline in EBITDA Margins: In 1HFY25, the company incurred EBITDA losses on account of an increase in operating expenses due to launching of two new channels and settlement of a contingent liability. Ind-Ra expects RTNL to report operating losses in FY25 and turn profitable from FY26. In FY24, the EBITDA margins declined to 4.55% (FY23: 6.73%) due to an increase in content production and up-linking charges. The margins were modest with a return on capital employed of 2% in FY24 (FY23: 2.4%).Deterioration in Credit Metrics: Ind-Ra expects the credit metrics to deteriorate in FY25 due to the operating losses and improve from FY26 on account of scheduled debt repayment and the likely increase in EBITDA. During FY25, RTNL availed a term loan of INR120 million for settling contingent liabilities. In FY24, the interest coverage (operating EBITDA/gross interest expense) improved to 1.93x (FY23: 1.85x) due to a reduction in financial charges on account of scheduled term loan repayment. However, the net leverage deteriorated to 4.18x in FY24 (FY23: 3.93x) on account of the decline in EBITDA to INR48.45 million (FY23: INR57.05 million).Continued Small Scale of Operations: In 1HFY25, RTNL booked revenue of INR613.66 million. In FY24, RTNL's revenue improved to INR1,064.9 million (FY23: INR847.88 million) on account of increased revenue from advertisement due to general elections and the growth of over-the-top (OTT) and digital channels. Ind-Ra expects the revenue to increase further in FY25 due to a rise in OTT channel subscribers and the launch of two new channels. Competitive Industry; Dependence on Advertisement Revenue: RTNL operates in highly competitive industry with ever-changing dynamics with significant transformation in digital media over the years. Ind-Ra believes a further dependence on advertisement revenue could lead to fluctuations in revenue and margins. Experienced Promoters: The company’s promoters have more than three decades of experience in the South Indian Television market. This has helped the company to expand its network in major parts of South India. Established Distribution and Client Network: The company has, over the last 30 years, developed a strong distribution network with direct-to-home (DTH) and cable operators. Furthermore, the company has distributors across the globe, which aids in generating export revenue.LiquidityStretched: RTNL's working capital cycle remained elongated at 109 days in FY24 (FY23: 110 days) as the reduction in the receivable period to 88 days (232 days) was offset by a decline in the payable period to 22 days (FY23: 122 days). The average maximum utilisation of the fund-based limits was 99.33% over the 12 months ended September 2024. In FY24, the cash flow from operations declined to INR12.88 million (FY23: INR277.21 million) due to unfavorable changes in working capital. Consequently, the free cash flow fell to INR10.01 million in FY24 (FY23: INR38.68 million). The company has scheduled debt repayments of INR16.6 million in FY25 and INR33.8 million in FY26. Furthermore, the company does not have any capital market exposure and relies on banks and financial institutions to meet its funding requirements. The cash and cash equivalent stood at INR26.7 million at FYE24 (FYE23: INR24.64 million).Rating SensitivitiesNegative: A decline in the scale of operations, leading to deterioration in the overall credit metrics and/or a further pressure on the liquidity position, all on a sustained basis, could lead to a negative rating action.Positive: An increase in the scale of operations, along with an improvement in the overall credit metrics with the interest coverage exceeding 2.0x and an improvement in the liquidity profile, all on a sustained basis, could lead to a positive rating action.About the CompanyIncorporated in 1994, RTNL is a television satellite broadcaster in southern part of India which operates 13 TV channels, one OTT channel and one digital channel in five languages. Prior to the incorporation, the promoters were in the business of movie production under the brand name Raj Video Vision since 1983.Key Financial Indicators Particulars FY24 FY23 Revenue (INR million) 1,064.60 847.88 EBITDAR (INR million) 48.45 57.05 EBITDAR margin (%) 4.55 6.73 Gross interest coverage (x) 1.93 1.85 Net leverage (x) 4.18 3.93 Source: RTNL; Ind-Ra Status of Non-Cooperation with previous rating agencyNot applicableRating History Instrument Type Rating Type Rated Limits (million) Current Rating/Outlook Historical Rating/Outlook 3 April 2024 Fund-based working capital limit Long-term/Short-term INR130 IND BB/Stable/IND A4+ IND BB+/Stable/IND A4+ Term loan Long-term INR92 IND BB/Stable IND BB+/Stable Bank wise Facilities Details Click here to see the details The details are as reported by the issuer as on (19 Nov 2024)#Bank NameInstrument DescriptionRated Amount (INR million)Rating1Canara BankFund Based Working Capital Limit130IND BB/Stable/IND A4+2Canara BankTerm Loan92IND BB/StableComplexity Level of the Instruments Instrument Type Complexity Indicator Fund-based working capital limit Low Term loan Low For details on the complexity level of the instruments, please visit https://www.indiaratings.co.in/complexity- indicators.

Rating Rationale Rating Rationale October 25, 2024 | Mumbai NELCO LimitedRatings reaffirmed at 'CRISIL A/Positive/CRISIL A1' Rating ActionTotal Bank Loan Facilities RatedRs.218.3 CroreLong Term RatingCRISIL A/Positive (Reaffirmed)Short Term RatingCRISIL A1 (Reaffirmed)Note: None of the Directors on CRISIL Ratings Limited’s Board are members of rating committee and thus do not participate in discussion or assignment of any ratings. The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities Detailed Rationale CRISIL Ratings has reaffirmed its ‘CRISIL A/Positive/CRISIL A1’ratings on the bank loan facilities of Nelco Ltd (Nelco). The rating reaffirmation reflects the strong market position of the company in the niche very small aperture terminal (VSAT) industry, high revenue visibility and the improving operational and financial risk profile. The ratings also factor in support from the Tata group, from which Nelco derives financial flexibility. The reaffirmation also reflects expectation of the company to witness improved and healthy revenue growth in FY25, especially with expectation of significant growth in revenue and profitability in second half of the fiscal 2025 as against the first half of current fiscal. Furthermore, the company is expected to maintain a healthy annual growth rate of more than 15% in revenue to support its leading market position and healthy operating profitability over the medium term on a sustained basis. This will be supported by the recurring nature of business, an expected increase in bandwidth revenue and increasing use of VSAT technology. Further, CRISIL Ratings expects the company to utilise operating cash accrual towards its business requirement, which should support sustenance of healthy capital structure. The expected growth in the scale of operations and operating profitability will be a key rating monitorable. Any delay against the same could result in a downward revision of the rating outlook. Revenue has posted a healthy compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~8% over the past 5 years, with healthy operating margin at 18-20% resulting in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) increasing to more than Rs 60 crore in fiscal 2024 and 2023, as against Rs 51 crore and Rs 45 crore in fiscals 2022 and 2021, respectively. Additionally, the company utilized its cash accrual towards debt reduction during the last fiscal with outstanding debt falling to Rs 57 crore as on March 31, 2024 from Rs 63 crore a year earlier (Rs 81 crore as on March 31, 2022). These strengths are partially offset by the working capital-intensive nature of business and inherent regulatory and technological risks. However, receivable days have witnessed improvement from ~100 in fiscal 2021 to 70-75 in fiscal 2024. Analytical Approach CRISIL Ratings has combined the business risk profile of its wholly owned subsidiary, Nelco Network Products Ltd (NNPL), while assessing NELCO. For arriving at the ratings, CRISIL Ratings has applied its group notch-up framework to factor in the extent of support available from the Tata group. Please refer Annexure - List of Entities Consolidated, which captures the list of entities considered and their analytical treatment of consolidation. Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description Strengths: Strong market position in niche VSAT industry; well positioned to tap the mobility space: Nelco is one of the leading players in the niche Rs 1000 crore VSAT industry with about 26% market share (in terms of cumulative VSAT installations) and 34% of revenue share. VSAT licenses in India are offered under license from Department of Telecom, Government of India (DoT). Once the VSAT license is obtained, operators require satellite transponder space, which is provided by New Space India Ltd (NSIL), a part of Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO; a Government of India company under Department of Space). VSAT scores over terrestrial telecom in applications where connectivity needs to be more reliable or where locations are remote. Nelco provides B2B VSAT services in banking, oil & gas exploration, renewable energy, telemedicine, mining and construction and rural education. It enjoys strong market share especially in the oil & gas and banking (ATM) segments. Revenue from the Inflight Maritime Communication (IFMC) business increased by ~11% from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024 even though its contribution remains more than 25% due to overall increase in revenue base. The air and maritime mobility space is expected to substantially expand the industry size in the medium term along with other upcoming streams such as cellular backhaul. With its partnerships with technology vendors such as Panasonic Avionics Corporation and Intelsat, Nelco is well positioned to benefit from growth in mobility. High revenue visibility: Nelco has two key revenue streams: (a) VSAT hardware sales, which pertains to one-time hardware installations, and (b) bandwidth and service usage, which is largely recurring revenue. About 75-80% of the revenue is from bandwidth and service usage with repeat customer profile (churn rate of 3-5%). This ensures high revenue visibility for the company. The terms with its customers are largely contractual in nature, with contract lengths varying from 1 to 3 years. With de-regularisation in the space sector and pacing up implementation of the New Space Policy 2023, new streams of VSAT usage will be coming up, which shall further support growth in revenue. Further, with evolution in technology, bandwidth fees are also expected to reduce, which is likely to result in making VSAT technology more competitive and could support increasing the consumer base. Improving operational and financial profile, though moderately high leverage: The operating and financial profile has been improving, due to the shift in focus on its VSAT services from automation and controls segment. The automation and controls segment, which contributed about 25% revenue in 2014, has been discontinued since 2017. The operating income of the company has increased steadily at a CAGR of ~8% over the past 5 years. Revenue growth remained subdued during the fiscal year 2024 reaching Rs. 320 crores compared to Rs. 314 crores in fiscal 2023. This was primarily due to the deferment of customer orders. The number of VSAT installations for the company was stable, ranging between 65,000 and 75,000 during fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024. As revenue and operating costs are largely recurring and contractual in nature, operating margin is expected to remain stable going forward. Further, the financial risk profile has improved over the past few years with total outside liabilities to tangible networth (TOLTNW) ratio and gearing at ~1.2 times and 0.57, respectively, as on March 31, 2024 (~1.5 times and less than 1 time, respectively, as on March 31, 2023). This has been supported by improving cash accrual and debt prepayments. The company is expected to incur a capital expenditure (capex) of Rs.90-100 crore annually over the medium term, which is to be funded through a mix of internal accrual and external debt.  However, CRISIL Ratings expects financial risk profile to remain healthy going forward, basis expectation of revenue growth with stable margins, supporting robust cash accrual. Financial flexibility enjoyed by being part of the Tata group: As on March 31, 2024, the Tata group through Tata Power and its subsidiaries, held 50.09% equity stake in Nelco. The company has board representatives from Tata Power. Mr. Ratan Tata was Chairman Emeritus in Nelco. As part of Tata group, the company will continue to enjoy financial flexibility. Weaknesses: Working capital intensive business: Gross current assets (GCA) were sizeable at 158 days as on March 31, 2024 (136 days a year earlier), driven by receivables of 75 days. Clients are majorly billed on quarterly basis. However, this is partly offset by credit period provided by suppliers (hardware providers) of 6-9 months. Though, a nominal cost is paid by the company for credit period over and above 3 months. Technology and regulatory risk: Nelco is dependent on technologies for VSAT hardware from other third-party global players such as VT iDirect and Gilat Satellite Networks, with proprietary technologies. Further, VSAT services are regulated by DoT. Any major change in policy pertaining to VSAT remains a key risk factor. Nelco also faces competition from terrestrial telecom providers which are cheaper and are increasing their connectivity to remote locations over time. The expected de-regularisation in this space with the execution of New Space Policy 2023 should reduce regulatory risk, however, due to constant technological advancements, threat from alternative sources will remain. Liquidity: Strong Liquidity is strong, marked by cash and equivalents of about ~Rs 22 crore as on March 31, 2024. Expected cash accruals in fiscal 2025 and 2026 are ~Rs 50-55 crore on yearly basis. Further, the company expects to incur capex of ~Rs. 90-100 crore (with a debt-equity mix of 70:30) and debt repayment obligation of ~Rs 33 crore. Utilisation of the fund-based limit averaged less than 10% in the six months through April 2024. The company also enjoys financial flexibility being a part of Tata group. Outlook: Positive CRISIL Ratings believes Nelco will benefit from the steady growth in revenue while maintaining a healthy operating margin. It is also expected to retain healthy debt metrics with prudent capital allocation towards capex. Rating sensitivity factors Upward factors: Substantial increase in scale of operations, leading to improvement in operating risk profile Substantial reduction in TOL, leading to material reduction in TOL/TNW to below 1.5-2x on sustainable basis Downward factors: Slower than expected growth in operating income (expected to be at or above Rs.380-400 crores) or operating profitability Weaking of operational metrics with lower-than-expected cash accruals leading to higher-than-expected debt funded capex resulting in gearing sustaining above 1.5-2x Change in ownership or support philosophy from Tata Group About the Company Nelco, established in 1940, is a subsidiary of Tata Power. The Company is in the business of providing domestic satellite communication services to close user group (CUG) networks via Satellite System on non-exclusive basis within the territorial boundary of India under the VSAT, ISP and other Licenses and authorisation granted by Department of Telecommunications (D.O.T.), Government of India.

Rating Rationale
Acuité has reaffirmed its long-term rating of ‘ACUITE BBB’ (read as ACUITE Triple Bo) n the Rs. 127.92 Cr.
and short-term rating of 'ACUITE A3+' (read as ACUITE A Three pluso) n the Rs.44.50 Cr. bank facilities of
Lokesh Machines Limited (LML). The ratings have been placed unde r'Rating watch with Negative
Implications’.
Acuité has also assigned its long-term rating of ‘ACUITE BBB’ (read as ACUITE Triple B o)n the Rs.36.00 Cr.
bank facilities of Lokesh Machines Limited (LML). The ratings have been placed unde r'Rating watch with
Negative Implications’.
Rationale for rating watch and reaffirmation :
Acuite has placed its outstanding ratings under watch with negative implications due to the company’s inclusion on
the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions list by United States Department of Treasury. This has led
to a decline in operating income and profitability in 9MFY2025, with expectations of continued impact on
operating performance in the near term. Acuite will continue to monitor the impact of sanctions imposed by US
Department of Treasury on the financial and business risk profile of the company.
Further, the rating reaffirmation takes into account the improvement in the scale of operations and profitability in
FY2024. Furthermore, it considers its healthy financial risk profile, the company’s long-term presence in the
market for more than two and a half decades, and its established relations with the customers which fetch repeated
orders.
The rating is, however, constrained by intensive nature of its working capital operations and intense competition in
the industry.
About the Company
Incorporated in 1983, LML is promoted by Mr. M. Lokeshwara Rao and Mr. B. Kishore Babu and started
commercial production in 1986. The company has six manufacturing locations, with five in Hyderabad and one in
Pune. The company’s operations are segregated into two divisions, namely the Machines and Components
divisions. The company is engaged in the design, development and manufacture of custom-built Special Purpose
Machines (SPMs), General Purpose CNC Machines (GPMs), Jigs & Fixtures and Machining of Automobile
Cylinder Blocks, Heads and Connecting Rods, Defense Systems and Precision Engineering Components among
others. LML also executes job work majorly for Mahindra & Mahindra Limited (M&M). The company's shares are
listed on the NSE & BSE.
Unsupported Rating
Not applicable
Acuité Ratings & Research Limited www.acuite.in
Analytical Approach
Acuité has considered the standalone business and financial risk profile of LML to arrive at the rating.
Key Rating Drivers
Strengths
Established track record in the machine tools industry and its long-term association with the clientele
The company’s long-standing presence, spanning nearly four decades, in the machine tools segment, has helped it
develop strong expertise in design and manufacturing capabilities, enabling it to provide customized machines to
customers. Further, the four-decade-long experience of the promoters in the Machines Tools industry has helped
build healthy relationships with customers (automotive original equipment manufacturers) and suppliers, and a
diversified distribution network which helps them with getting repeat orders to an extent. The company ranks in the
top 5 CNC Machine Manufacturers in India. Acuité believes that the promoter’s experience, understanding of the
market dynamics and established relationships with suppliers and customers will continue to support the business
profile over the medium term.
Healthy financial risk profile
The company’s financial risk profile is healthy, marked by healthy net worth, low gearing and moderate debt
protection metrics. The net worth of the company stood at Rs.195.44 Cr. and Rs.158.67 Cr. as on March 31, 2024,
and 2023 respectively. The improvement in net worth is due to the accretion of reserves and equity infusion.
Gearing of the company stood at 0.60 times as on March 31, 2024, against 0.56 times as on March 31, 2023. Debt
protection metrics – Interest coverage ratio and debt service coverage ratio stood at 3.66 times and 1.86 times as
on March 31, 2024, respectively, as against 3.20 times and 1.70 times as on March 31, 2023, respectively.
TOL/TNW (Total outside liabilities/Total net worth) stood at 1.00 times and 1.06 times as on March 31, 2024,
and 2023 respectively. The debt to EBITDA of the company stood at 2.81 times as on March 31, 2024, as against
2.57 times as on March 31, 2023. Acuité believes that the financial risk profile will remain healthy in the absence
of any major debt-funded capital expenditure plan in the near term.
Weaknesses
Working capital intensive operations
LML’s working capital operations are intensive, marked by high gross current Asset (GCA) at 223 days in FY2024,
although improved from 254 days in FY2023. The GCA days are impacted mainly on account of high inventory
days. The inventory levels of the company have been historically high owing to the lengthy order execution cycle.
As these are capital goods, a large part of the inventory remains in the work-in- progress stage. Inventory days
stood at 170 days in FY2024 as against 194 days in FY2023. Debtor days stood moderate at 51 days in FY2024 as
against 53 days in FY2023. Subsequently, the payable period stood at 83 days in FY 2024 as against 83 days in
FY2023. Further, the reliance on bank limits utilization stood at ~89 percent for the fund-based limits and 49
percent for the non-fund-based limits for the past seven months ending in January 2025. Acuité believes that the
working capital operations of the company will remain intensive, as evident from its high inventory levels.
Improvement in operating performance in FY2024, albeilt moderation in 9MFY2025
The company witnessed an improvement in its operating revenue marked by y-o-y growth of 22.15 percent in FY
2024, which stood at Rs. 293.54 Cr. in FY 2024 as against Rs. 240.30 Cr. in FY 2023. The improvement in
revenues is on account of the increase in utilization levels due to higher order flow and demand revival in the end-
user sectors (primarily auto), procurement of CNC machines by customers for productivity and technology
improvement initiatives, and favorable industry outlook. The company has an unexecuted order book position of
Rs.80.25 Cr. as on January 2025. However, in 9M FY2025, the company’s operating revenue moderated to Rs.
189.63 Cr. as against Rs. 213.20 Cr. in 9M FY2024. The moderation is due to its inclusion on the OFAC sanctions
list of the United States Department of Treasury. Further, Acuite learns from the management that it has taken
steps to resolve the issue, and expects a favorable outcome in the near term. Going ahead, Acuite will continue to
monitor the impact of the sanction on the overall financial and business risk profile of the company.
Intense competition in industry
LML continues to face stiff competition from domestic players in the standardized machinery segment and from
imports in the case of high value-added specialized and customized products, which limits its pricing flexibility
and margins to an extent. Further, the company’s margins remain susceptible to fluctuations in raw material prices
as its orders are of a fixed price in nature. Its major raw materials include steel and steel components.
Furthermore, the revenue profile is also concentrated on the auto segment; the auto industry has been facing
headwinds in the recent fiscal and, thereby impacting demand for LML’s products and its profitability. However,
going forward, consolidation in the industry and LML’s efforts to diversify its sectoral space are likely to support
its revenues.

Rating Sensitivities
Significant growth in revenue and profitability
Further stretch in the working capital cycle leading to an increase in working capital borrowing and
weakening of financial risk profile
Deterioration in capital structure and other credit metrics due to any large, debt-funded capex/acquisition
Removal of company’s name from OFAC sanction list
Liquidity Position: Adequate
LML's liquidity is adequate, marked by adequate net cash accruals to its maturing debt obligation. The company has
generated cash accruals of Rs.23.82 Cr. in FY2024, while its maturing debt obligations were Rs. 5.37 Cr. during
the same period. Going forward, the company is expected to generate sufficient net cash accruals against its
maturing debt obligation. The current ratio stood at 1.30 times as on March 31, 2024. Further, the reliance on bank
limits utilization stood at ~89 percent for the fund-based limits and 49 percent for the non-fund-based limits for
the past seven months ending in Jan 2025. The company maintained an unencumbered cash and bank balances of
Rs.0.21 Cr. as on March 31, 2024. Acuité believes that the liquidity of the company is likely to improve over the
medium term.

Note on complexity levels of the rated instrument
In order to inform the investors about complexity of instruments, Acuité has categorized such instruments in three
levels: Simple, Complex and Highly Complex. Acuite’s categorisation of the instruments across the three
categories is based on factors like variability of the returns to the investors, uncertainty in cash flow patterns,
number of counterparties and general understanding of the instrument by the market. It has to be understood that
complexity is different from credit risk and even an instrument categorized as 'Simple' can carry high levels of
risk. For more details, please refer Rating Criteria “Complexity Level Of Financial Instruments” on www.acuite.in.

The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings.1 crore = 10 millionRefer to Annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities Detailed Rationale CRISIL Ratings has reaffirmed its ratings on the bank facilities of Salzer Electronics Ltd (SEL) at 'CRISIL A/Stable/CRISIL A1'. Further, CRISIL Ratings has withdrawn its rating on the commercial paper (CP) programme of SEL at the company’s request. There is no outstanding against the CP, as confirmed by the issuer. The rating action is in line with the withdrawal policy of CRISIL Ratings. SEL is expected to record a revenue growth of around ~13-14% in fiscal 2024 from 33% in fiscal 2023 due to slower offtake from end-user segments amid elections and slowdown in exports. However, turnover is expected to register 18-20% growth in fiscal 2025, driven by the switch gear segment and sales of wire and cable products on account of uptick in industrial demand, healthy growth in building products segment and anticipated improvement in offtake from key export markets of North and South America and Europe. Increasing push by the Ministry of Power under its Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) to replace all the existing energy meters with smart meters will drive revenue growth in the smart meter division. SEL is currently setting up a unit to manufacture smart meters at a cost of ~Rs 33 crore, and revenue offtake is expected from the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Furthermore, gradual pick-up in the LAN (local area network) cable business and continued demand from the agriculture sector for wires and cables are also expected to support revenue growth over the medium term. Operating margin for  fiscal 2024 is set to improve 40-50 basis points (bps) on-year to ~9.8% in fiscal 2024 from 9.3%, supported by moderation in raw material prices and price hikes; resulting in improved revenue under the switch gear and wires & cables segments. Margin is expected to increase further by 60-70 bps in fiscal 2025 on the back of healthy share of exports, launch of new products (smart meters), and expected price hikes amid stable raw material prices. CRISIL Ratings has also noted that, during fiscal 2024, promoter group entities –  Salzer Spinners Ltd, Salzer Exports Ltd and Quebec Information Services India Ltd – have exercised their outstanding share warrants which has augmented the networth by ~Rs.33 crore during the fiscal. This was part-funded through term debt of ~Rs 15 crore raised by the group entities by pledging promoter shareholding in SEL; and the debt obligation will be met by promoter entities. After this transaction, the promoter shareholding increased to 37.32% as of March 2024 from 33.18% as of March 2023. The ratings also factor in the company’s adequate financial risk profile, including healthy debt protection metrics. Gearing was estimated to be comfortable at ~0.64 time as of March 31, 2024, despite increase in working capital debt over the past two fiscals. Gearing is expected to improve further with only nominal debt-funded capital expenditure (capex) expected over the medium term. Interest coverage ratio is expected to be 3-4 times. Annual cash accrual of Rs 80-85 crore will be adequate to meet modest debt obligation. Working capital limit was utilised ~89% in the nine months through February 2024. The ratings continue to reflect the leading market position of SEL in the domestic rotary switches market, healthy relationships with key industrial clients, extensive distribution network and adequate financial risk profile. These strengths are partially offset by exposure to intense competition in the fragmented wires and cable industry and large working capital requirement. Analytical Approach CRISIL Ratings has combined the business and financial risk profiles of SEL and its subsidiaries, Kaycee Industries Ltd (Kaycee), Salzer EV Infra Pvt Ltd and Salzer Kostad EV Chargers Pvt Ltd as these entities operate under a common management and have significant business and financial linkages. Please refer Annexure - List of Entities Consolidated, which captures the list of entities considered and their analytical treatment of consolidation. Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description Strengths Healthy revenue growth from existing and upcoming new products, aided by strong market position in the domestic rotary switches market, healthy relationship with industrial clients Revenue growth is likely to remain steady, supported by the market leadership of SEL in the cam-operated rotary switches segment, strong product profile and established clientele. The acquisition of the nearest market competitor, Kaycee, in fiscal 2020 (a pioneer in industrial switches) was complimentary and synergistic to the existing business and further stabilised the market position of SEL. The acquisition also helped SEL to expand its footprint into railways and provided access to a pan-India dealer network. Sustained revenue growth is expected to be driven by new products in the industrial switchgear segment and the marketing and distribution arrangement with Schneider Electric India Pvt Ltd (SEIPL; ‘CRISIL AAA/Stable/CRISIL A1+’). SEIPL is the erstwhile electrical and automation division of Larsen & Toubro Ltd (L&T). Furthermore, revenue offtake from the smart meter business, which is under implementation, is expected from the second half of the current fiscal and will be a key driver for the company’s growth in the long term. Continued focus on research and development and technology tie-ups with global majors should help maintain competitiveness. Adequate financial risk profile Networth estimated to be ~Rs 455 crore as on March 31, 2024, due to steady accretion to reserves, which led to a gearing of ~0.63 time despite debt addition of Rs 12-15 crore during the fiscal to fund capex. Debt protection metrics were healthy, as reflected in estimated net cash accrual to total debt and interest coverage ratios of ~0.21 time and ~3.0 times, respectively, for fiscal 2024. Capex of ~Rs 35 crore in the current fiscal to set up the smart meter plant and meet regular expansion expenses will be partly funded through debt of Rs 17-20 crore. The expected higher contribution from smart meters and stable raw material prices for existing products will help improve operating profitability to 10.5-11% over the medium term from 9.5-10% in fiscal 2024. Along with steady revenue growth, this will lead to stable cash generation, thereby keeping debt metrics healthy. Weaknesses Working capital-intensive operations Gross current assets are expected to remain high at ~211 days as on March 31, 2024, because of sizeable inventory as the company manufactures a wide range of products and stocks raw materials (especially copper) when commodity prices are favourable. Receivables remain stretched at over 100 days on account of inherently long payment cycle extended to customers, majority of who are original equipment manufacturers. Prudent working capital management will remain critical over the medium term. Exposure to intense competition in the electrical cables industry Domestic manufacturers of electrical installation products face intense competition from the unorganised sector and cheap Chinese imports as the industry has low entry barrier and the technology can be easily replicated. Although longstanding relationships with customers with guaranteed offtake and introduction of value-added products will support overall offtake in the electrical cables segment, continued exposure to competition may limit profitability. Liquidity: Strong Cash surplus is likely at ~Rs 15 crore as on March 31, 2024. Furthermore, expected annual cash accrual of Rs 80-85 crore will adequately meet yearly debt obligation of Rs 7-9 crore and capex plans of ~Rs 35 crore over the medium term. While bank limit was utilised by ~89% for the nine months through February 2024, with estimated gearing of ~0.64 time as on March 31, 2024, the company has sufficient headroom to raise additional debt to meet capex or incremental working capital requirement. Outlook Stable CRISIL Ratings believes SEL will continue to sustain its steady business performance supported by healthy demand for existing products such as switchgears and cables as well as better contribution from new products  including smart meters. Better operating leverage and continued control on costs along with stable raw material prices will enable a gradual improvement in operating margins, also benefiting cash generation. SEL’s financial risk profile is also expected to remain at adequate levels over the medium term, supported by prudently funded capex plans. Rating Sensitivity factors Upward Factors Sustained revenue growth, including from new products, and operating margin in the range of 11-12%, also benefitting cash generation Sustenance of healthy debt metrics, through prudent funding of capex and improved working capital levels Downward Factors Sustained decline in revenue and fall in operating margin to below 8-9% also impacting cash generation. Large, debt-funded capex or acquisition or further stretch in the working capital cycle weakening the key debt metrics About the Company SEL, incorporated in 1985, SEL manufactures cam-operated rotary switches, toroidal transformers, cable ducts, isolators, modular switches, relays and automotive products. It has five manufacturing units in Coimbatore and one unit in Hosur (both in Tamil Nadu). The company has a longstanding relationship with SEIPL (the erstwhile electrical and automation division of L&T, which remains the largest customer for SEL's cables). SEL also has a marketing association with SEIPL for sale and distribution of its electrical installation products in India and a few overseas markets. SEL sells products overseas through associate company, Salzer Exports Ltd. In May 2019, SEL entered into a share purchase agreement to acquire shares representing 72.32% stake in Kaycee from its principal promoter, Universal Trust Pvt Ltd, and subsequently, in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, SEL increased its stake to 74.91%. Total cost of acquisition, of around Rs 18 crore, was funded through internal accrual. Kaycee manufactures rotary cam switches, weather tight switches and breaker control switches. SEL reported consolidated operating income of Rs 839 crore and profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 33 crore for the first nine months of fiscal 2024, against Rs 734 crore and Rs 29 crore, respectively, in the corresponding period previous fiscal.

*Instrument details are provided in Annexure-1
Rationale
The ratings reaffirmation for Garware Technical Fibres Limited (GTFL or company) reflects its strong business and financial
profiles, with a market leadership position across many of the segments and geographies that it operates in. The company’s
focus on value-added product offerings and efforts to introduce technologically advanced products continue to aid its business
prospects as well as profitability, with GTFL reporting operating profit margins of 16-20% over the past few years. The company
remains well diversified across geographies and industry segments.
GTFL registered a modest 2% YoY revenue growth in FY2024, as export volumes remained muted through the fiscal on account
of demand slowdown for certain products due to overstocking across the supply chain. While revenues from the domestic
business had a modest YoY growth in FY2024, the geosynthetic division continued to report a robust YoY revenue growth
momentum, albeit on a narrow base. With operational challenges associated with export sales largely abating in FY2025, the
company reported an improvement in its export volume offtake, which, coupled with healthy operational performance of the
geosynthetic division led to GTFL reporting 17% YoY revenue growth in 9M FY2025. Aided by steady domestic performance
and moderate YoY volume growth envisaged for export sales, GTFL is expected to maintain a moderate YoY revenue growth
momentum over the medium term.
ICRA notes GTFL’s strong conservative capital structure and liquidity position along with healthy profitability indicators,
supported by an improved product mix, prudent working capital management and strong cash flow generation from the
business. Its liquidity position remains strong, with GTFL reporting cash and investments of more than Rs. 660 crore as on
September 30, 2024. Moreover, with strong accruals, prudent working capital management and moderate capex plans, it
continues to generate free cash flow from operations. ICRA expects GTFL’s capital structure as well as coverage indicators to
remain strong going forward as well, with the company maintaining a net-cash surplus position and the Total Debt/OPBIDTA
remaining well below 1.0 times over the medium term.
The rating strengths are partially offset by a price-sensitive domestic market, which may impact GTFL’s profitability, and
competition from the unorganised segment. The relatively sluggish demand for key product segments (especially the premium
range of products where GTFL has dominant presence) in the domestic segment in the recent past may restrict revenue growth
prospects of the company. Nevertheless, its active efforts to gain market share in the domestic fishery industry have led to a
steady improvement in the company’s domestic business performance in FY2024 and H1 FY2025, which mitigates the said
challenge to an extent. The growth prospects and profitability of the company remain exposed to global economic activities
and foreign exchange (forex) movements, given the substantial revenue contribution from exports.
ICRA also notes the recent rounds of share buyback by GTFL (of ~Rs. 110 crore in FY2023 and ~Rs. 245 crore in the present
fiscal, FY2025). With an expected strong cash flow generation, and limited avenues for capital expenditure (capex), ICRA
expects the company to continue buybacks/dividend payouts to the equity shareholders. While ICRA does not anticipate any
www.icra .in 1
Page |
material influence of share buybacks on the company’s credit profile or liquidity position, going forward, the quantum and
frequency of such buybacks would remain the key rating monitorable.
The Stable outlook on GTFL’s rating reflects ICRA’s opinion that the company will continue to benefit from its established track
record in the synthetic fibres industry in the domestic and overseas markets. The company demonstrates healthy revenue
visibility on the back of its strong market presence across different product categories in the domestic and overseas markets.
Key rating drivers and their description
Credit strengths
Strong market position in domestic synthetic fibres industry; diversified revenue streams with steady and gradual growth
in agri-tech, geosynthetic business and coated fabrics – GTFL has over four decades of experience in the cordage industry and
commands a dominant share in the organised domestic market. Over the years, the company has established a healthy brand
for its fishnets, ropes and twines, among others, catering to multiple business segments including fisheries, aquaculture,
agriculture, shipping and industrial sectors. The company also offers project-oriented services through its geosynthetic
division, which has witnessed a robust growth momentum in the recent past, with expectations of the same to be maintained,
going forward. Such diversified segmental presence provides stability to GTFL’s business against any segment-specific
slowdown risks while also offering sufficient revenue visibility to the company.
Healthy profitability, strong capital structure, coverage indicators and liquidity position; improved working capital cycle
leads to healthy cash flows – The company’s profitability and return indicators remain strong with OPM of 16-20% and RoCE
of more than 20% reported over the past few years, on the back of healthy operating performance and consistent
improvement in the product mix towards value-added products. Healthy cash flows from operations and limited outgo for
capex requirements have helped GTFL to maintain a healthy capital structure, evident from its gearing and TD/OPBITDA of 0.1
times and 0.5 times, respectively, as on September 30, 2024. Moreover, its liquidity profile remains robust, with cash and liquid
investments (including investments in fixed maturity plans) of more than Rs. 660 crore, as on September 30, 2024, and a
healthy buffer in the form of unutilised bank lines (Rs. 152 crore, as on September 30, 2024, and Rs. 145 crore, as on December
31, 2024).
Widening portfolio of premium products driven by increased focus on value-added products – The share of GTFL’s premium
product portfolio has been increasing over the past few years, driven by increased focus on innovation and a customer-centric
approach. The share of value-added products went up to 70-75% during the last three to four years from the ~50% seen
historically. The increasing share of premium products in the overall revenue ensures better pricing flexibility for the company.
Geographically diversified revenue mix – Exports constituted around 57% of GTFL’s revenue in FY2024 (61% in H1 FY2025).
The company is present in more than 75 countries with healthy positioning in the developed markets of North America and
Europe, which contribute to the bulk of its export revenues. Access to overseas markets insulates GTFL’s revenue profile from
fluctuations in the domestic market and provides higher growth opportunities. The company is gradually making inroads into
new geographies, as well as expanding its premium product offerings for the export markets.
Limited competition in domestic market in major product segments – The company competes with various organised as well
as unorganised players in the domestic market. However, focus on premium products and investment in research and
development (R&D) initiatives have helped GTFL establish a brand name for itself in the market, and sustain its market position
over the years.
Credit challenges
Price-sensitive domestic market results in volatility in operating margins – The company operates in a price sensitive and
fragmented domestic market, which is characterised by unorganised players. Further, the upward price movements in end-
products (fishnets, twines, ropes) could result in a demand-side pressure from the retail segment. However, supported by an
www.icra .in 2
Page |
increasing share of value-added content, a premium product portfolio and adequate pricing flexibility, GTFL continues to
command healthy operating margins.
Sluggish domestic demand in key product segments restricts revenue growth prospects – Domestic demand for the
company’s key products (especially in the premium segments where it has a notable presence) has been relatively stagnant
over the last few years, due to limited penetration of premium products in the domestic fisheries industry and extreme
weather events in various regions. Thus revenue growth is restricted in the Indian market. However, GTFL is focusing on value-
added products (through increasing awareness about the strength and durability and premium product offerings) as well as
exports to offset the muted demand in the domestic market. Export sales provide a substantial growth opportunity to the
company, because of a larger market size and its competitive cost advantage over other players in the developed economies.
Growth prospects and profitability exposed to global economic environment and forex movements – GTFL derives more
than 60% of its revenue share from the export market and, as a result, it remains exposed to the global economic environment
and foreign currency volatility. To mitigate the demand risk from a specific overseas market, the company has been
geographically diversifying its revenue base. The forex-related risks are mitigated to some extent by the natural hedge from
imports, which coupled with a few hedging practices of the company, mitigate the foreign currency volatility to an extent.
GTFL’s profitability is also partially exposed to the volatility in crude oil prices as the prices of its key raw materials—mainly
high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP)—are linked to crude oil price movements.
Environmental and Social Risks
Environmental considerations: GTFL operates in the synthetic fibres space, which is characterised by processes and products
with environmental implications and is, therefore, exposed to the risk of tightening regulations related to environmental
norms, and potential penalties in case of non-compliance. Further, as some of its products are used in connection with natural
resources (for example, fisheries), any restrictions on the use or on its customers in this space can have implications on the
company's business. However, the company has been undertaking various measures to ensure that such risks are mitigated to
a large extent. Few of such measures include preferring HDPE over nylon in its manufacturing to keep a check on carbon
emissions, increasing usage of renewable energy sources, and focusing on more environment-friendly product offerings, such
as cages with negligible copper sedimentation.
Social considerations: The company’s exposure to social risks mainly pertains to safe operations and remaining compliant with
various regulations to ensure the safety of its employees and the community in the vicinity of its manufacturing units.
Additionally, retention of skilled employees remains important from a business continuity point of view. For this, GTFL
periodically undertakes various initiatives towards employee engagement, training and development, welfare, awards and
recognition, etc.
Liquidity position: Strong
The company’s liquidity profile is strong, supported by unencumbered cash and liquid investments of over Rs. 660 crore, along
with unutilised bank lines of Rs. 152 crore, as on September 30, 2024. Given healthy accruals and the absence of any large
capex or long-term debt exposure at present, the company is likely to generate free cash flows that further support its liquidity
profile.
Rating sensitivities
Positive factors – Significant improvement in the scale of operations, on a sustained basis, and strengthening of the business
profile through increased product diversification, while maintaining comfortable profitability and capital structure, may lead
to a rating upgrade.
Negative factors – A rating downgrade could be triggered by a sustained slowdown in key end-user industries and markets,
exerting pressure on liquidity, profitability or coverage indicators. A deterioration in coverage indicators, i.e., total
debt/OPBIDTA above 1.0 times on a sustained basis, might also lead to a downward rating. Any large debt-funded capex or
www.icra .in 3
Page |
inorganic investments, weakening the credit profile or liquidity position, on a sustained basis, might also lead to a downward
rating.

Details of instruments/facilities in Annexure-1.
Rationale and key rating drivers
The revision in the ratings on the bank facilities of Mangalore Chemicals & Fertilizers Ltd (MCFL) factors expectation of sustainable
improvement in the operating efficiencies of the company resulting in higher generation of gross cash accruals (GCAs).
The implementation of energy improvement programme (EIP) and its commissioning from September 2022 onwards led to
decrease in MCFL’s actual energy consumption to 5.8 Gcal/MT which earlier stood at 6.3 Gcal/MT. Energy consumption is expected
to further improve to 5.5Gcal/MT in the next fiscal year. Furthermore, FY22 was the first fiscal year since when MCFL operated
on Natural Gas as feedstock after receiving gas in December 2020 and the subsequent conversion of the urea manufacturing
process by the company from naptha-based feedstock to natural gas. The allowable consumption norms for the company from
December 2020 till December 2025 is 7.356Gcal/MT as per the New Urea Policy 2015.
The improved operating efficiencies driven by the above factors resulted in significant improved operating profitability since
Q3FY23. The company is expected to derive significant benefits in FY23 leading to higher operating profitability in current fiscal
over FY22 resultantly leading to improvement in gross cash accruals (GCAs) in FY23 despite plant shutdown undertaken in Q2FY23
for improvement of EIP. Normalized operations at current pooled gas prices from the next fiscal onwards is expected to generate
incremental profitability and GCA.
The ratings also consider in the faster release of subsidy by the government in last couple of years leading to reduction in the
outstanding subsidy receivables of the company and thereby reducing its reliance on the working capital borrowings. The ratings
continue to derive strength from MCFL’s established position in the Southern states of India with wide customer base, its long
track record of operations in fertilizer industry and diversified product range. The ratings also take cognizance of the company
being part of Adventz group with diversified business & operational synergies with other companies of the group in the fertilizer
business. These rating strengths are, however, partially offset by its leveraged capital structure, high dependence on timely
fertilizer subsidy receivable from the government and highly regulated nature of the fertilizer industry.
Rating sensitivities: Factors likely to lead to rating actions
Positive factors – Factors that could lead to positive rating action/upgrade:
• Improvement in its liquidity position along with healthy profitability and lower working capital borrowings and sustained
improvement in credit metrics leading to net debt to PBILDT below 2.5x
• Substantial positive impact of any regulatory/policy change
Negative factors – Factors that could lead to negative rating action/downgrade:
• Any increase in the collection period leading to elongation in the operating cycle of more than 200 days on a sustained
basis.
• Major debt-funded capex or increase in working capital borrowings to fund large subsidy receivables leading to Net debt
to PBILDT deteriorating above 3.5x on sustained basis beyond FY23.
• Any adverse changes in the regulations governing the fertiliser industry
Analytical approach: Standalone

Press Release
Outlook: Stable
The rating outlook “Stable” indicates sustained improvement in the operating performance over the medium term leading to
strengthening of the GCA deriving majorly from the recently executed EIP. Furthermore, the company’s capital structure is
expected to gradually ease over the medium term supported by expectation of incremental GCA.
Key strengths
Improved operating performance on the back of implementation of EIP and Conversion to Gas Based Plant
Since November 2020, the company has started receiving gas supply after successful laying of gas pipeline from Kochi, Kerala to
MCFL, Mangalore. After successful testing and commissioning, urea manufacturing with the feedstock of natural gas had started
since December 12, 2020. Before the commissioning of pipeline for supply of gas, the company has been receiving subsidy based
on the criteria for naphtha-based units i.e. at current Govt. notified specific consumption (SEC) norms of 6.902 GCal/ MT and with
the conversion of plant to Gas based plant, the subsidy will be received at 7.356 GCal/ MT (for the next five years from the date
of commencement of gas based production, i.e., December 15, 2020). This is expected to result in additional profitability to the
company till the time such SEC is allowable or latest by December 2025. The energy norm will be revised at 6.50 Gcal/MT after
a period of five years after receipt of natural gas. With the receipt of gas, the company is also eligible for vintage allowance and
also makes the company eligible to produce urea beyond Reassessed Capacity (RAC). FY22 was the first full year when MCFL
operated on Natural Gas as feedstock after receiving gas in December 2020 and the subsequent conversion of the urea
manufacturing process by the company from naptha-based feedstock to natural gas.
MCFL has completed its EIP much in advance in FY23 and its current energy consumption stands at 5.81 G.Cal/MT since Q2FY23
from earlier consumption of 6.3Gcal/MT. This leads to incremental accrual benefits on account of energy savings which is expected
to increase from 1.02G.cal/MT in FY22 to 1.55- 1.7G.Cal/MT over next couple of years.
MCFL will produce 50,000 MTPA less Urea than its assessed capacity in FY23c due to loss of production during the interim period
when plant shutdown was taken for implementation of EIP. This when compared to FY22 is 1,00,000 MTPA less production.
However, despite the lower production, MCFL is estimated to achieve a higher absolute profitability (i.e. PBILDT) in FY23 owing
to reduced energy consumption on account of EIP.
At current pooled gas prices and improvement in operating efficiencies, the company’s PBILDT margin is estimated to be 9.10%-
9.20% in FY23 improving from 7.45% in FY22 leading to estimated rise in GCA to approximately ₹200 crore in FY23. This is
despite lower production in FY23 on account of plant shutdown (taken in Q2FY23 for implementation of EIP). These accruals are
expected to further improve in the medium term when the plant will operate on a full year with complete production on EIP.
Established position, long track record of operations and wide customer base
MCFL commenced production of Ammonia & Urea in 1976, set up Ammonium bicarbonate plant in 1982, Di-ammonium phosphate
and captive power plants in 1986, Sulphonated Naphthalene Formaldehyde plant in 2010 and Specialty Fertilizers plant in 2011.
MCFL is one of the leading companies catering to the fertilizer markets in Southern India. About 72% of the company’s products
are sold in the state of Karnataka, which meets about 11% of the needs of the farmers in the state. MCFL also maintains good
market share in Kerala and a modest share in neighbouring states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra.
The fertilizers and plant nutrient products are marketed in these regions through a network of more than 4,000 dealers leading
to wide customer. The company has been able to operate at a with total operating income estimated at ₹3500 crore in FY23
rising from ₹2896 crore in FY22. The rise in TOI was majorly on account of higher commodity prices which were a complete pass
through.
The top 10 customers account for less than 10% of the total operating income signifying its diversified customer profile
Part of diversified group; however, moderation in liquidity and financial profile of the holding company in the past
MCFL is a part of the Adventz group which has interests in agri-inputs, engineering, infrastructure, real estate, consumer durables
and services sectors. MCFL was earlier a UB group company, however, in May 2015, Zuari group acquired an additional 36.56%
stake in MCFL over and above its earlier 16.47% stake to become the majority stakeholder in the company with 54.03% stake at
present. As part of the Adventz group, MCFL is being benefitting from centralized procurement of key raw materials at group level
leading to the benefit of economies of scale, a strong marketing and distribution network, resulting in better cost efficiencies,
besides the savings in fixed overheads as a result of integrated operations with the other group companies which are in similar
line of business. The parent company of MCFL, Zuari Agro Chemicals limited (ZACL), is the flagship company of the group and
also acts as a holding company for the other group companies engaged in manufacturing of fertilizers while the non-fertilizers
business are under another holding company, Zuari Global Limited (ZGL). ZACL’s liquidity position deteriorated considerably in
FY19 due to which it faced cash flow mismatches and was not able to timely service its debt repayment obligations. However,
the company had been regular in meeting all its debt obligations since the beginning of January 2020 with the unsecured loans
provided by the promoters, the release of the subsidy by Government of India (GoI) and collections from the market. Further,
ZACL has raised funds by monetization of its assets (Goa Plant) to its Group company Paradeep phosphate Limited. The sale of
these assets and the resultant fund raising help ZACL to deleverage its balance sheet. Further, MCFL is not dependent for financial

Press Release
support from its promoters as seen in the past since its acquisition and is an independent operating company and is only being
benefitting by leveraging the group operational and business linkages with better reach to market. Furthermore, as on December
31, 2022, the total pledge stood at 63.06% of the promoter shareholding i.e. 38.23% of total outstanding shares.
Key weaknesses
Leveraged capital structure albeit improvement expected with higher accruals going forward
Capital structure of MCFL is leveraged on account of higher working capital borrowings. The net overall gearing (adjusted for
acceptances) of the company which improved from 3.22x as on March 31, 2020 to 1.21x as on March 31, 2021 moderated to
1.79x as on March 31, 2022 owing to increased working capital borrowings on account of increased subsidy receivables year on
year on the back of higher production in FY22 as MCFL produced beyond its reassessed capacity and also on account of increased
commodity prices of Natural Gas and complex fertilizers. Net debt (including acceptances and adjusted for cash balance) which
stood at ₹1752 crore at FY20 end and reduced to ₹735 crore at FY21 end, increased again to 1223 crore at FY22 end on account
of higher working capital borrowings and also on account of marginal term debt which came due to energy improvement program.
Accordingly, the net debt to ebitda levels which improved from 8.47 in FY20 to 3.51x in FY21, moderated to 5.66x in FY22 but is
estimated to improve to 4.10x-4.20x by FY23 end and shall improve further to 3.06x on account of enhanced profitability when
MCFL will operate the entire year on improved norms and accrue higher operating profits.
MCFL is expected to undertake projects of sulphuric acid and capacity expansion in DAP over next two to three years but are
expected to be judicious with the mix of debt and equity/internal accruals to make sure the net debt to ebitda levels are maintained
range bound till 3.5x and not moderate significantly. Any debt funded capital expenditure which has a significant impact on its
credit profile or leverage indicators shall remain a key monitorable.
Regulated nature of the fertiliser industry and inherent delays associated with the release of the subsidy from the
GoI:
The profitability of fertiliser manufacturers is influenced by the regulations governing various types of fertilisers, wherein, the
government controls the fertiliser prices and provides subsidies. The quantum of subsidy receivables and delays associated with
the receipt of the same inherently impacts the liquidity of the fertiliser industry, albeit differs with the type of fertilizer. During
FY22, the fertilizer manufacturers curtailed the production of a few fertilizers, primarily DAP, wherein, few manufacturers incurred
losses in FY22 due to the multi-year elevated input prices. However, there has been a sharp upward revision in the subsidy rates
for all the nutrients for H1FY23. In the Union Budget for FY23, the GoI had initially provided for a total fertilizer subsidy of ₹1.05
lakh crore, which was subsequently enhanced by another ₹1.10 lakh crore in May 2022 looking at the elevated prices of key raw
materials and natural gas, thereby taking the total fertilizer subsidy budget for FY23 to an all-time high of ₹2.15 lakh crore. The
shortfall in the subsidy budget amid the volatile raw material prices may lead companies to resort to higher short-term borrowings
to fund extended subsidy receivables. Regular intervention by the government to increase the subsidy budget, NPK nutrient rates,
and minimum selling prices (MSP) help the sector to work in a regulated manner. The government is also planning to implement
the second phase of DBT and is planning to explore the option of directly transferring the subsidy to the farmers’ accounts, which
can be beneficial for the fertilizer companies. However, it will have a substantial burden on the government finances, and
accordingly, the rollout of the second phase of DBT can take some time.
Exposure towards fluctuations in raw material prices
MCFL procures Regasified Liquefied Natural Gas (RLNG) for the manufacturing of urea and imports phosphoric acid and ammonia
for manufacture of complex fertilizers, and also imports Di-Ammonium Phosphate [DAP] and Muriate of Potash [MOP] besides
other variants of complex fertilizers for trading. The raw materials and the traded goods derive their prices from the global crude
price while international prices of DAP and MOP etc., are based on the demand and supply, therefore the turnover of the company
fluctuates based on the global crude & commodity prices and are also vulnerable to exchange rate movement.
Vulnerability of sales to agro-climatic conditions
Financial health of the fertilizers manufacturers largely depends on the sowing season, vagaries of rainfall, status of subsidy outgo
and the existing channel inventory level.
Liquidity: Adequate
The company derives its adequate liquidity from its healthy cash & cash equivalents, moderate cushion between GCA and
repayment obligations. MCFL has total working capital limits to the tune of around ₹2,500 crore which are largely utilized in the
form of Bills discounting, Letter of credit and buyers credit and is 78% utilized for last 12 months through February 2023.
Free cash and cash equivalents were ₹502 crore as on March 31, 2022 & as on December 31, 2022 was ₹352 crore. MCFL has
scheduled repayments of ₹68 crore vis-à-vis estimated GCA of ₹200 crore during FY23. Even over the next two years debt
3 CARE Ratings Ltd.
Press Release
repayments are ₹99 and ₹50 crore respectively which may be comfortable met out of the expected accruals over the medium
term.
ESG Profile: Fertiliser manufacturing, particularly urea, has a significant carbon footprint as natural gas is the key raw material
for hydrogen which goes into ammonia production and thereafter urea. GoI is expected to provide adequate policy support to the
sector if the hydrogen requirement through the green route is mandated by GoI for the sector.
Agro-climatic risk remains a key risk for the sector given the fact that a significant portion of the Indian agriculture sector remains
dependent on the monsoons and with changing climate patterns which may impact fertiliser offtake. The sector is also socially
important, given its role in ensuring food security and rising concerns related to excessive usage of fertilisers and its impact.
MCFL has been undertaking its part on the environment, social and governance front as follows:
Environment

Time Technoplast Limited: Ratings reaffirmed; rated amount enhanced

Programme enhanced amount
Total 450.00 525.00
* Instrument details are provided in Annexure-I
Rationale
The reaffirmation of the rating factors in Time Technoplast Limited’s (TTL/the company) extensive operating track record in
the plastic packaging industry with an established market presence. The company enjoys a leading market position for most
of its product segments in the domestic and global markets with a varied product mix and exposure to diverse end-user
industries. Further, over the last few years, its product mix has improved through the addition of new products, which is likely
to yield diversification benefits and aid revenue growth and profitability. TTL’s financial profile is strong, characterised by low
gearing and healthy coverage indicators. Although TTL’s liquidity profile is adequate, ICRA notes the company’s high borrowing
rates.
In 9M FY2025, the company’s revenue grew ~11% YoY on a consolidated basis, aided by demand recovery for established
products and increase in the sales of value-added products with slight uptick in the operating margins as the share of value-
added products has risen. The capital structure and coverage indicators have also remained healthy. Going forward, the
company’s focus on increasing the share of value-added products and a healthy ramp-up of sales in the segment, driven by a
strong order book for composite cylinders and the capacity expansion underway in the segment, will aid product diversification
and improve the operating margin profile.
ICRA notes that, the company was earlier looking to consolidate/restructure the overseas business by divesting its majority
stake in these entities and the proceeds were planned to be used for debt reduction, capex funding and the benefit of
shareholders. However, the plan has been shelved, and the company will be focusing on growing its overseas business as well.
TTL has also taken the board approval for raising Rs. 1000 crore in equity through a Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP)
which it plans to utilize as a backup plan if it has to incur significant capex for some of the products under development. The
same will remain a key monitorable.
The company is present in the highly fragmented packaging industry, characterised by intense competition, which limits its
pricing flexibility. The working capital intensity of operations also remains high, mainly due to the high inventory requirements,
and the same has remained elevated in the last three fiscals. Further, the price of its key raw material — high-density
polyethylene (HDPE) — is derived from crude oil, thereby exposing TTL’s profit margins to the volatility in raw material prices.
With majority of its raw material requirement being met through imports, it is exposed to volatile foreign currency exchange
rates. However, TTL hedges a predominant share of its foreign exchange exposure, mitigating the risk to an extent.

Key rating drivers and their descriptions
Credit strengths
Diversified product portfolio and geographical mix; leading position in various product categories – TTL is a leading
manufacturer of industrial packaging products, with operations in the domestic and international markets across Asia, US and
the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, where it is present through its subsidiaries. It has a diversified product
portfolio comprising products for industry segments such as industrial packaging solutions, technical and lifestyle products,
infrastructure-related products, material handling solutions, composite cylinders and multilayer multi-axial oriented cross
laminated films (MOX films). Over the last few years, the company’s product mix has improved through the addition of new
products, which is likely to yield diversification benefits and aid revenue growth and profitability. TTL is one of the leading
players in various product categories like industrial packaging products (Asia and MENA region), composite cylinders and
intermediate bulk containers (worldwide).
Well-diversified customer base resulting in low customer concentration risk: TTL has a well-diversified customer base, spread
across different industry segments. The company’s top 10 customers contributed to ~20% of its standalone revenues in
FY2023, reflecting low customer concentration risk. Over the years, it has developed strong relationships with reputed
customers, which helps in procuring repeat orders.
Strong financial profile characterised by low gearing and healthy coverage indicators: TTL’s revenue has been witnessing
healthy growth driven by healthy demand for its products resulting in a revenue growth of ~14% yoy in FY2024 and 11% yoy
growth in revenue in 9M FY2025. The company’s profitability at operating level has been stable with OPM% of 13.8% in FY2024
and 14.3% in 9M FY2025 supported by rising share of value-added products in revenues. With stable cash generation, the
overall credit profile of the company has remained healthy. The coverage indicators also remained healthy in FY2024, with
total debt/ OPBDITA of 1.2 times (1.6 times in FY2023) and interest coverage ratio of 6.8 times in FY2024 (5.5 times in FY2023).
The interest coverage ratio has further improved 8.22x in 9M FY2025.
Credit Challenges
Fragmented industry and intense competition exert pressure on profitability – TTL faces competition from a few large
established and numerous smaller-sized players because of the low entry barriers in the industry. However, for a few products
like polymer drums, IBCs, composite cylinders, etc, TTL is one of the leading players worldwide. The company faces competition
in the industrial packaging segment from metallic container manufacturers. However, there has been a gradual reduction in
the industry-wide usage of metallic containers on account of the various benefits that plastic containers have over their
metallic counterparts, coupled with the reducing price differential between polymer drums and their steel counterparts. The
threat from imports is negligible owing to the freight-intensive nature of polymer products.
Ability to manage volatility in major raw material prices resmains critical – HDPE is the major raw material for TTL’s products
and its prices are primarily derived from crude oil prices that are highly volatile in nature. However, as the company is in the
business-to-business (B2B) space, it is able to pass on the impact of input price fluctuations to its customers with a time lag of
about 15-20 days, depending on the terms of the contracts with its customers. However, the minor fluctuations cannot be
passed on immediately to remain competitive in the market.
High working capital intensity of operations, arising mainly from high inventory requirements – The company’s working
capital intensity remains moderate with NWC/OI of ~39% in FY2024. It has a policy of stocking 60 days of raw material
inventory, depending on the raw material price movement and the average transit period is 15-20 days. In addition, it
maintains ~30 days of finished goods inventory, including work-in-progress (mainly running products inventory). Most of TTL’s
raw material requirement is imported against letter of credit (LC), while domestic purchases are made against advance
payments.

Environmental and social risks
ESG related comments
As per the disclosure made by the entity in the FY2024 annual report, it complies with all the applicable environmental
regulations/laws and adopts adequate safety measures for its employees. The company has also been taking measures for
energy and water conservation. The plastic materials are reused in accordance with the regulatory and standard norms of the
State/Country. In certain instances, the waste is either sold to registered vendors or transported to authorized recyclers.
Internally generated materials are grinded and reused in a manner that ensures optimal quantity without compromising
quality.
Liquidity position: Adequate
TTL’s liquidity is expected to remain adequate with expected healthy cash flow from operations, on a consolidated basis. The
cash flow from operations of the company are expected to witness healthy uptick in FY2025 owing to increase in operating
profit along with low incremental working capital requirements. On a consolidated basis, the company has a repayment
obligation of ~ Rs. 80 crore and planned capex of ~Rs. 175-200 crore over FY2025-26, with the capex expected to be financed
largely through internal accruals. The average fund-based utilisation stood at ~92% for the last 12 months ended Jan 2025 and
the company has healthy cushion in its working capital facilities, while unencumbered cash, bank balance and liquid
investments were at ~Rs. 153.5 crore as on March 31, 2024.
Rating Sensitivities
Positive factors – Not applicable
Negative factors – Any large debt-funded capex and/or deterioration in the working capital cycle putting pressure on the credit
profile could lead to a downgrade. Another key credit metric for downgrade would be the consolidated TD/OPBDITA exceeding
1.8 times on a sustained basis. Additionally, pressure on the rating might arise if the company’s 12-month average utilisation
of fund-based limits (including CP utilisation) exceeds 85% of its drawing power on a sustained basis.
